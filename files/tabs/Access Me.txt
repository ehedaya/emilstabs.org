A F#m x 2
First time I came over
I was bitten by your dog
You weren't even there 
cuz you were walking in the fog

D E x 2
I called you up and plead and beg
and talk to your machine
My friends say not to bother
when you're actin' pretty mean

A F#m   x 2
But I don't mean to bother you
no I won't play that part
I just want access
to the inside of your heart

D E x 2
Access to your thoughts
on the way that I should be
So I can start to change
And maybe you can Access Me

Access Me...



Basically it just switches between the major keys and the minor keys.
Same notes, different key.  Also, they're not playing straight chords.  
The song is driven by the bass (I think it's a Mike song) and Trey is 
just sort accompanying it with the spacy guitar sounds he usually 
reserves for jams.
