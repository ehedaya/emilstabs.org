[Intro]
 
C Bb F Gm
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
F             C
They will come
Am         G
On pillow jets of sound
F                  C
The proof of wonder
Am                  G
Celestial starlight gowned
F                   C
The ghost enchanter
Am        G
The eagle guide
F
Beautiful and brown
F
Beautiful and brown
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
F              C
They will come
Am        G
To form one tribe
F                 C
The tone romancer
Am             G
Mosaic spirit scribe
F             C
Crimson robed
Am              G
And golden firelight crowned
F
High above the ground
F
High above the ground
 
[Chorus]
C                    Bb
On pillow jets of sound
C                    Bb
On pillow jets of sound
C                    Bb
On pillow jets of sound
C                    Bb   C
On pillow jets of sound
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
F             C
They will come
Am                      G
Sewing star threads through the air
F                    C
With silver serpents
Am              G
That spiral in their hair
F              C
Sounding bells
Am             G
Elusive and unbound
F
High above the ground
F
High above the ground
 
[Chorus]
Am                     G
On pillow jets of sound
F                      Bb
On pillow jets of sound
Am                     G
On pillow jets of sound
F                      Bb   C
On pillow jets of sound
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
F             C
They will come
Am                  G
Through smoke rings in the glare
F                    C
With mace and discuss
Am                 G
Slicing through the air
F              C
Restoring light
Am                 G
As the lost become the found
F
High above the ground
F
High above the ground
 
 
[Outro]
(C and Bb the entire time)
 
C                    Bb
On pillow jets of sound...
(Harlequin kaleidoscopic)
C                    Bb
On pillow jets...
(Prismatic velvet tones)
C                    Bb
On pillow jets...
(Pulsating halcyon specter)
C                    Bb
On pillow jets...
(Flaming visions, shadow drawn)
C                    Bb
On pillow jets...
(Vivid phantoms hovering)
C                    Bb
On pillow jets...
(So high above the ground)
C                    Bb
On pillow jets...
(The conjurors of thunder)
C                    Bb
