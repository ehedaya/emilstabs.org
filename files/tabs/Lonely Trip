       E                 A
When I see through the deception
        E               A
And the river's flowing free
        E              A                                  E  A
You may understand the reason why I'm drifting out to sea
 
        E               A
And you may control the currents
     E                  A
As I drift in search of land 
        E              A                                   E  A
You may understand the reason when the water turns to sand
 
CHORUS:
   E
So while you're on this lonely trip
A
Keep a watch for other ships
E         F#     G#  B       A
And if by chance our vessels pass
E
While you're on this lonely trip
A
Keep a watch for other ships
E         F#     G#  B       A
And if by chance our vessels pass
n/c                                 E  A   E  A
Perhaps we'll finally meet at last
 
     E                    A
When doors are all closed tightly
     E                  A
With words the only keys
        E                 A                                   E  A   
You may understand the reason why I'm floating on the breeze

       E                  A
When I hear your voice responding
        E                   A
When no questions have begun
        E                  A                              E  A   
You may understand the reasons why I'm flying to the sun

CHORUS:
   E
So while you're on this lonely trip
A
Keep a watch for other ships
E         F#     G#  B       A
And if by chance our vessels pass
E
While you're on this lonely trip
A
Keep a watch for other ships
E         F#     G#  B       A
And if by chance our vessels pass
n/c                                 E  A   E  A
Perhaps we'll finally meet at last
