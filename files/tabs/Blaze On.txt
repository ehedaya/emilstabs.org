C
climb that hill, stay on your feet
G                                 C
scramble for your footing when it gets too steep
(C)
you’re on the highway now with higher hopes
      G                                C
while all around are rolling eggs with living yolks

          F                      C
you never get too sad, you never get too blue
G                                     C
it must be all the chemtrails raining down on you
            F                           C
the justice of the peace can’t help you anymore
    G                                 C
and they just took the covers off the justice of war

(C)
you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
           G                          C
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
(C)
you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
           G                          C
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on

F C G C
F C G C

(C)
the storm is passing through, lay down your sticks and stones
               G                        C
the struggle's over now, we’re all just flesh and bones
(C)
we were wrong before, it was wrong to trust
      G                    C
the shadows cast were only light and dust

             F                      C
and then one day you find to your intense delight
     G                            C
that three wrong turns can really make a right
           F                        C
so why not be like me?  be proud of all your crimes
              G                      C
‘cause when I screw up once, I do it two more times

(C)
you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
           G                          C
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
(C)
you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
           G                          C
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on

             F                      C
and we’ll be dancing in the fields, running through the moor
G                            C
tripping on the barbed wire, buried near the shore
F                     C
blazing like a comet, brighter than the full moon
       G
so you better get ready, ‘cause a change is coming soon

        F                   C
I met a liar called the messiah
          G                    C
I got the frying pan, I wanted fire
        F                  C
I saw a red dress, I met a daughter
          G
I got the quicksand, I prayed for water

             C
you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
           G                          C
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on

you got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
           G                          C
so now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
