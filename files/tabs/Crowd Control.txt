Crowd Control
Intro: E    B    E

E
Listen now I'm talking, I've been here for weeks
A
Waiting in this growing crowd, Staring at my feet
E                                                B      Bsus4  B
The world around me's turning, I'm just standing still
E                              B                 E
The time has come for changes, Do something orwe will

I'm a feather in a storm, I'm a raindrop in a sea
If I don't get enough of you, I'm a lighter shade of me
Sisters, brothers all around, there's a devil in the crowd
Meet his eye and it's the end of time, if you’re praying don’t be loud
 
Bridge:
D
It's crowded in the lowland
E
But the fools stay on the hill
D
You control us now you have the reins
		    B
Do something or we will

So show us why we came here, 'fore we lay on the ground
Give it to us loud and clear, make the devil turn around
The world around me’s turning, I'm just standing still
The time has come for changes, do something or we will
