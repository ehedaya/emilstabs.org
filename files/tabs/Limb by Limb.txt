The shoulder that I leaned on was carved out of stone  
But when I'm done freezing I want to be alone

Never want my hand cut off      Never want a hacking cough
Never need a cliffside push Never turn my brain to mush
Always give me what I lack Always take the best parts back
Always recognize your fate Always just a moment late
Left is where I always turn Left is how I'm forced to learn
Left the room my walking takes Left to alone with my mistakes  
Up against a person who Up til now I never knew
Up from hell the answer blew Up and down it's up to you.  
(1st part again)
Drop me off the chinese wall and peel my fingers off the rim
I come unglued while in mid-air and land to reform limb by limb
limb by limb by limb by limb (repeating throughout following verse)



Mike:  And I am taken far away....


Trey:   Lingering slowly and melting away
Tossed with the salad and baled with the hay
Pooling like water that drips from above
Trampled by lambs and pecked by the dove
