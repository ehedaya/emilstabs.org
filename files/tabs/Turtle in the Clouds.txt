INTRO & VERSES: Em-G-C-B

Em            G
Shadows
C             B               Em   G
Shadows crawl toward me as I wander
C          B                 Em   G
Along the shoreline past the people
C     B             Em G C B
And I turn and walk away

     Em         G
House party
C              B              Em  G
My friends are dancing on the hillside
C          B                    Em    G
For the first time in a long time
C        B                 Em G C B
I wanna live another day
Em G C B (2x)
Oooooooh

Am                    C        (fill)
I see a turtle in the clouds
                               G
Did I just say that right out loud?
                              D
Now I've got something in my show
Am                             C    (fill)
The green and yellow concrete park
                          G
The hotdog vendor in the dark
                             B
We rode our bikes out in the rain

Em         G
Imaginary rulebook
C       B           Em  G C B
I keep within my head
Em              G
Don't know why I followed
C       B            Em G C B
All the things it said
Em           G
So pay me no attention
C     B                  Em G C B
As I blend in with the mob
Em            G
Some people call me clueless
C       B             Em G C B
My last name is Wallob
Em  G    C   B
Clueless Wallob
Em   G   C     B
Clueless Wallob

Am                    C        (fill)
I see a turtle in the clouds
                               G
Did I just say that right out loud?
                              D
Now I've got something in my show
Am                             C    (fill)
The green and yellow concrete park
                          G
The hotdog vendor in the dark
                             B
We rode our bikes out in the rain

(Then a hard strum on Em and pause, followed by Em, G, C, B jam)
