B arpegio
I am water, dancing in the light
Shimmering by the sweeping shore

B         A                         E
Moving in darkness with the setting sun

B arpegio
In the afterglow of divine mind
A resonating tone

B          A                     E
Beneath the waves calls me in my dream

Back to B arpegio

G#m                A
And I am ripped in two

G#m                       A 
The breathing winds speak slowly 

G#m           A        Back to B arpegio
Mercy, Mercy, Mercy


Hearts bend
Folded red
Please don't go
Rise in fire and slip away

I am singing now
Over the fear
And remembering how
The changes come on the way down

And I am ripped in two
The breathing wind speaks slowly
Mercy
Mercy
Mercy

And I am ripped in two
The breathing wind speaks slowly
Mercy
Mercy
Mercy

I am water
Dancing in the light
Shimmering by the sweeping shore
Moving in darkness with the setting sun
