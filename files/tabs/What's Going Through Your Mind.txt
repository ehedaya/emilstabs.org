What's Going Through Your Mind

Gm

VERSE

Gm
The storm had passed by quickly, as the evening got its start
Eb
The moon, full, brightly lit the sky as clouds began to part
Bb
Saffy grabbed the phone and promptly notified the tow
F
Tick, emerging from below, was shocked at what he found

Gm
In one corner, Jennifer stood firm like she'd been taught,
Eb
while Mikey cried for someone to protect him from his thoughts
Bb
Saffy's food was thrown at Jen who still refused to bend
F
Pylon kept repeating that "my sword's my only friend"

Gm
Everyone started dancing to a song they couldn't stand
Eb
It started just this slowly, but it soon got out of hand
Bb
Penni racing down the stairs went crashing into Ken
F
Jennifer begged Tick to "drop the needle, start again"

Gm
Chester wandered in dressed like the Salamander Prince,
Eb
He entertained the cat all night, I haven't seen it since
Bb
Dregma spent the evening only staring out the door
F
Saf complained how Tick would never notice what she wore

Gm
A hog cried out beneath the din but no one seemed to hear
Eb
Finally the furniture stopped trying to interfere
Bb
The crown began to dissipate, but Tick could smell the spore
F
These actions, like a drug, would always bring them back for more (more more more)

CHORUS
Gm                                   Eb
Through the years we've suffered most
Eb                            Bb
From things we've never spoken
Bb                     F
Still, I think you know
F                                      Gm
If looks could kill we'd both be broken
Gm                                  Eb
Though, after all this time it seems
Eb                         Bb
We're not each other's kind
Bb                           F
Never think that I don't know
F                         Gm
What's going through your mind (mind mind mind mind mind...)

VERSE 2
Gm
Misty morning madness forms a shell around my brain
Eb
Pulls my foot inside the window to protect it from the rain
Bb
I rise again in silence but I hear a distant call
F
I turn toward the disturbance, find a zipper in the wall

Gm
As I slowly peel it open it reveals a blinding light
Eb
So I stumble through the portal as a force destroys the night
Bb
Adjusting to the brightness as the scene begins to fold,
F
I'm surrounded by resentment, or a mirror of my soul

Gm
Ashamed of my reflections I reverse and try to flee
Eb
But the image that I run from only seems to follow me
Bb
The portal that I came through just ahead within the haze,
F
dissolves as I approach it and I only find a maze

Gm
Though my strategy is wasteful and I fail at every turn
Eb
these corridors I wander are the least of my concerns
Bb
For the walls are made of mirrors, so despite what you may say,
F
No matter where I turn, I know I'll never get away

CHORUS
Gm                                   Eb
Through the years we've suffered most
Eb                            Bb
From things we've never spoken
Bb                     F
Still, I think you know
F                                      Gm
If looks could kill we'd both be broken
Gm                                  Eb
Though, after all this time it seems
Eb                         Bb
We're not each other's kind
Bb                           F
Never think that I don't know
F                         Gm
What's going through your mind


[COUNTERPOINT, SUNG OVER THE CHORUS]

(Perhaps a dream could prompt you to
Rewind the film that torments you
And show to me the one you mean
Who's tied so closely to our dreams

For you make reference many times
saying that I'm not deprived
By this silent entity
Who commandeers the dreams inside your mind)

Jam on Gm
