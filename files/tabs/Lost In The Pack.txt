Lost In The Pack – Anastasio, Marshall, Marks

Arpeggiate the C chord for the intro riff 

C                F
There’s a little cave out back where 
C           F
I can go to hide
C                F     
When I’m there I always phone you
C         F
Up to say goodbye

C              F
Somehow, I can never seem to 
C                F
Find the words I seek
C                           F
or maybe it’s just that the signal 
C
is too weak

C                      F                           
Or maybe it’s that the satellites are
C              F
Really hard to find
C	           F								
And my tiny dish was never
C        F
Properly aligned

C                   F
The words I want to tell you just get
C              F
Lost up in the sky
C                     F
Or maybe I just don’t want to say 
C
goodbye

Em            F
I’m so far gone
C
I’m barely here
G
Caught in between

Em          F
I’m nowhere near

F
I‘m far beyond 
C
Lost in the pack
F
So far behind
C
I can’t come back

C                 F
There’s a special stretch of road
C                   F
I drive to clear my mind
C               F
A river crosses underneath then
C                F
Back a couple of times

C                       F
Then it finally makes a turn to
C              F
Where I cannot say
C                 F
Maybe it leads me back to
C          F
You someday

Em         F
I’m so far up

C
I’m out in space
G
Can’t see ahead

Em           F
I’ve lost my place

F
I’m so far out
C
I’m in again
F
So long as you 
C
Remain my friend

C
So far gone
F
I’m barely here
C
Caught in between
G
I’m nowhere near

F
I’m far beyond
C
Lost in the pack
F
So far behind
C
I can’t come back

F
I’m so far up
C
I’m out in space
F
Can’t see ahead
G
I’ve lost my place

F
I’m so far out
C
I’m in again 
F
So long as you
C
Remain my friend


F
So long as you 
C
Remain my friend

F
So long as you 
C
Remain my friend
