[Intro] 
          Ab   Eb   Db
What's to be        settled
          Ab     Eb   Db
Changing lanes        sinking
          Ab   Eb   Db
What you see        is moving
    Bb                    Db
And you      know what to do

C         Am             G
Shut down everything you said
Bb               F                            G
Upstairs on your weekend perch, the greyhound rises
C         G               F
          Slashing at the sky
F                                        G      F
On my knees in the summer sun and I know nothing

F                 G      F
           I know nothing
F                 G      F
           I know nothing
F                 G      C

[Chorus]
C         G              F
Shut down everything you said
F                                             G
Upstairs on your weekend perch, the greyhound rises
C         G               F
          Slashing at the sky
F                                        G      
On my knees in the summer sun and I know nothing
C         G                   F
          Through the jig-saw night
F                                              G      
Traveling at the speed of sound, the greyhound rises
C                        F
          everything you said
C                        F
          everything you said

[Bridge]
Am                C
Falling, falling, why do all the streams and swollen 
Am                             G
rivers seem to call me back to you?
Am                           C
And I'm calling, calling, no matter how I scream,
Am               G
nothing's coming through.

[Chorus]
     C         G              F
So I Shut down everything you said
F                                             G
Upstairs on your weekend perch, the greyhound rises
C         G               F
          Slashing at the sky
F                                        G      
On my knees in the summer sun and I know nothing
C         G                   F
          Through the jig-saw night
F                                              G      
Traveling at the speed of sound, the greyhound rises
C                        F
          everything you said
C                        F
          everything you said
