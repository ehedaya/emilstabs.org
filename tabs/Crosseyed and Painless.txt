Verse:
 Lost my shape-Trying to act casual
Can't stop-I might end up in the hospital
I'm changing my shape-I feel like an accident
They're back-To explain thier experience

isn't it weird,looks to obscure to me
wasting away,that was their policy
Verse:
I'm ready to leave-I push the facts in front of me
Facts lost-Facts are never what they seem to be
Nothing there-No information left of any kind
Lifting my head-Looking for the danger signs
Melody:
There was a line-There was a formula
Sharp as a knife-facts cut a whole in us  (2x)
Chorus:
I'm still waiting...(8x)
Melody:
The feeling returns-whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head-looking around inside   (2x)
Verse:
The island of doubt-is like the taste of medicine
Working my hindsight-got the message from the
oxygen.
Making a list-find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right-facts are useless in emergencies
Break3:


Verse:
Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are late
Facts all come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing in the face of things
Facts don't stain the furniture
Facts go out and slam the door
Facts are written all over your face
Facts continue to change their shape
Chorus:
