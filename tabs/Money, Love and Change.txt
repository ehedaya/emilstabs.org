Verse:
F Eb Bb
I've got a minute, sixty tiny pieces of
F  Eb   Bb
Your silver dollar, for time is money, money love
Ab   Bb     Eb  Bb(not sure about this)
Don't set your watch back, who are we to rearrange
F   Eb   Bb
These sixty minutes, and i could never count the change

Chorus:
Bb        F   Ab   Eb
Some live their days hidden from themselves
F    Eb       Bb  (Not sure about the Eb, i think it's right)
Afraid of money love and change

(x2)

You got a minutes them give them to a friend
And try to change every moment that you can
I feel desire measured by the clouds above
What will it cost me? Time is money, money love

chorus

Bridge:
Eb      Bb
Well it's funny don't you know
F Bb C D E(i think)
That change is the one thing you can count on
Eb Bb
Wondering where does it go
    F
If i had more money i would buy some time

(little progression up F by horns and then trey)
