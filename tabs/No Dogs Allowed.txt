[Ascending Line]


F            F#dim7
No Dogs allowed
Gm7        Am7
No Dogs allowed
Dm(7?)      G             C          C#dim
No Dogs allowed in the subway today 

Gm               F#aug
So climb up the stairs
F                  F 
And be on your way 
                C                                F
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today


Bb                            Eb
If dogs were allowed then just think of this place 
Bb           Ab                Eb/G
A city of dogs living here in this space
Fm            Gm            Ab           Cm
Whining and running from dawn until dark 
Bb                          Eb
My head would be aching from hearing them bark


So there's 
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed in the subway today

So climb up the stairs
And be on your way
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today

If dogs were allowed then the people would shout 
And tell me to order those dirty dogs out 
I'd have to decide who would get to sit down 
Would the dogs or the people ride into town

So there's 
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed 
No Dogs allowed in the subway today 

So climb up the stairs
And be on your way
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today

If dogs were allowed then the trains would be filled 
With creatures that never, no never stand still
There wouldn't be room for the people at all 
The trains would be cluttered with dogs big and small
