Dm F         Bb          C    G
     Another letter to remind me
     Walk in circles on the phone
     While this distant thought surrounds me
     I let it settle on the ground

C             Dm               Bb                   C
Whenever you find it, look all around, you’re never alone
But if you rewind it, love on a line, I will follow you home

What said in tunnels to remind me
Spread out in liquid on the ground
And drawn in circles all around me
Until its time to set it down

Wherever you find it, look all around, you’re never alone
Until you rewind it, love on a line, I will follow you home
Whenever you find it, look all around, you’re never alone

Solo (Don't know what chords this is over, verse or chorus probably?)

So if your hinge is on a line
What falls away and rolls along
And when our breathing is divided
We weather battles on our own

And so if you find it, look all around, you’re never alone
Until you rewind it, love on a line, I will follow you home
Wherever you find it…
But if you rewind…

End solo(?)
