I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like.

                                                           G
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and things to make it look good.

    D                                G
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.

D
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.


I'll give you anything, everything if want things.


G                        C7
I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.

                                                                   G
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black. I've had it for months.

       D                                G
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.

                             G
I don't know why. I call him Gerald.

     D                              G
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.

I've got a clan of gingerbread men.

                                       G
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.

D                                  G
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.

I know a room of musical tunes.

                                         G
Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork.

      D                          G
Let's go into the other room and make them work.
