Here by the sea and sand nothing ever goes as planned, 

                D D                  E E 
I just couldn't face going home 

              A          Asus4   A 
It was just a drag on my own.

They finally threw me out, my mother got drunk on stout, 

                D     D              E E 
My dad couldn't stand on two feet, 

                     A             Asus4 A 
As he lectured about morality. 

                D   D                 E E 
Now I guess the family's complete, 

                 G            D 
With me hanging 'round on the street 

   D           A 
Or here on the beach. 

Cadd9      G/B               Am     
The girl I love is a perfect dresser, 

Fmaj7       Em              D            Dsus4 D Dsus2 D 
Wears every fashion gets it to the tee.

Heavens above, I got to match her 

Fmaj7                  Em               D     Dsus4 D 
She knows just how she wants her man to be

Leave it to me. 

    A              A/G A   A        G      D/A 
My jacket's gonna be  cut slim and checked 

        A            A/G A          A    G    D/A 
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck 

         A    A/G A           A        G   D/A 
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat 

          A       A/G  A      A        D/A 
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet. 

I see her dance, across the ballroom 
UV light making starshine of her smile. 
I am the face, she has to know me, 
I'm dressed up better than anyone within a mile. 

So how come the other tickets look much better? 
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter. 
How come the girls come on oh so cool 
But yet when you meet 'em, every one's a fool? 

Come sleep on the beach, keep within my reach 
I just want to die with you near I'm feeling so high with you here. 
I'm wet and I'm cold but thank God I ain't old 
Why didn't I ever say what I mean? 
I should have split home at fifteen 
There's a story that the grass is so green, 
What did I see? Where have I been? 

G          D               D           A 
Nothing is planned, by the sea and the sand 

D/A    A   A/G A         A           G D/A   

D/A                 A                G D/A   
I'm the face if you want it...
