I took the 1st version posted here (below) and made some adjustments.  
Thanks to the person that got it started!


Main riff:
                A                  D
E---------------0--0--0------------2-2-2------------------------------------
B---------------2--2--2------------3-3-3-----------------------------------
G---------------2--2--2------------2-2-2------------------------------------
D---------------2--2--2----------0-0-0-0------------------------------------
A-------0---0---0--0--0------0----------------------------------------------
E----0h2--2---------------0h2--2--------------------------------------

A                 D
It's no easy road, this struggle and strife
Bm                A
We find ourselves, in the show of life
A                      D
What's on the schedule, what's on your plan?
Bm                 A
Do you ever ignore, what you don't understand?
Bm                          A
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know
       Bm                             A
I just fasten my seat belt wherever I go
          F#m                      
It's been perfectly planned
     Bm
It’s completely insane
                                     A			(repeat intro)	
It’s a revolving cast	but it's the same old game


A               D
Waves of people, they come and they go
Bm                A
Shine for a while, in this marvelous show
A                 D
It’s limited time, that we exist
Bm                     A
We slowly make our way, into the mist
D               A
My thoughts are racing
      D                             A
I see faces of the friends that I recall
D          (SN: C#   Ab)  F#m  
I'd like to     take this time 
B            E5
To thank you all


A                         D
Just as the blind imagine, what it is to have sight
Bm                      A
We slowly take a stroll, into the night
A                 D
It's no easy road, this struggle and strife
   D    C# Bm        n/c            A        D
We find ourselves... in the show of life
               A        D			   
In the show of life
               A        D
In the show of life 

(Mike/Page: Find ourselves right here)
