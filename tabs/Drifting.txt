Trey Anastasio

Intro

G F C   (Trey inverts these some too in the Intro)

Verse  G  F  Am*  G

Ive seen trey use a C in place of the Am* on some live stuff,
but I think Am sounds better, jut play whatever sounds better to you


G                F    Am*  G                 F Am G 
I've been drifting,       for years at sea 

Chorus (Pretty much Am>D, throw in descending bass notes to fill out the sound)

Am              D/F#   Am        Am/G        D/F#           
The fog is lifting,  we got the moon and the stars abooove


Solo over G F Am G
