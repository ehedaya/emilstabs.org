Anything But Me
(Anastasio/Marshall/Herman)

E           A/E       E               A/E  
I am just a satellite, high above the atmosphere
E             A            B                  B/A
Bouncing everything you say to someone who is meant to hear
   D                    A
Sometimes on a rainy day, I lie in bed and dream of you
E                   A/E                  B             E          A/E ...etc.
So blame it on the satellite, when your message can't get through

same as first verse
I am just a tiny wave, a minor ripple out at sea
Moving slowly towards the shore, burdened with uncertainty
I'm gaining power, losing speed, wondering as I near your door
Will you hold it open for the tidal wave approaching shore?

B                B/A           E
You've become an island in the hazy world surrounding me
D                      A
Offering a vast reward each time I safely cross the sea
C#m                        B
All too often I become lost in the fog and haze
D                                A                       E      A/E, E
Clinging still, against my will, to promises of clearer days

same as first verse
I am just a raindrop that accelerates without control
Losing bits and pieces in descent 'til I'm no longer whole
I am just another shooting star above that you might see
Until I have your full attention I'll be anything but me
