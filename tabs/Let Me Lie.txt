Gonna ride it slowly

(this progression continues for the entire song, aside from the bridge)

Leave me way up here up on the mountain 
Let me lie uncovered on the floor
Make me wonder when you go away again 
If you're ever coming back here anymore

Gonna take my bike out, take my bike, 
Gonna ride it slowly, gonna ride just how I like
Gonna take my bike out, take my bike, 
Gonna ride it slowly

I don't care what you did but I can tell it's hanging over you 
The effects of sun and sand are hard to understand
So leave me way up here up on the mountain 

[Bridge Eb  Fm (x4)]                                                  
Let me lie, oooooh... oooooh... oooooh... oooooh
Db Eb Ab(quick change back to original progression)      

Gonna take my bike out, take my bike, 
Gonna ride it slowly, gonna ride just how I like

Gonna use my brakes when I go down hill gonna climb back on when I take a spill 
Gonna peel my shirt off gonna feel it burn gonna keep my eyes closed gonna miss my turn

Gonna take my bike out, take my bike, 
Gonna ride it slowly,

Let me lie...let me lie (x4)

solo

Let me lie...let me lie (x4) 

(end on Ab)
