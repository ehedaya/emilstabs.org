Lyric Transcription 

By Mike Gordon

Quiet- "Dr Davis, Telephone please"

"I catapult downtown

To see the galleries and my favorite fiancee

In a lavender gown

But Im hooked up to a machine

It performs my daily functions through a tube in my vein

But today that thing malfunctioned

Like a forest fire
 
It burned a hole in me, I perspired

So there aint gonna be no wedding

No love affair

No art to which none compares"
