Lick #1

E           D             A      C
Sometimes I feel like I'm fading away
E                 D            A          C
You're looking at me, I've got nothing to say
E             D              A              C
Don't make me angry with the games that you play
D               A           E
Either light up or leave me alone

Lick #1

E              D         A         C
You walk in my room, you lie in my bed
E             D       A C
You open your mouth, shoot someone dead
E        D             A         C
All of a sudden you're inside my head
D               A           E
Either light up or leave me alone

Lick#1

Lick#2 X3

Lick #3

JAM (E)

Lick #2 X3

Lick #3

E           D             A         C
Spending my bread like it grew on a tree
E                D                 A             C
You're trying to tell me 'bout the birds and the bees
E                     D              A         C
The skirt that you're wearing is way past your knees
D               A           E
Either light up or leave me alone

Lick #1

E             D     A              C
You're up all night preaching your mind
E                D                 A      C
Come home in the morning with your latest find
E                 D             A               C
I'm gonna have to lay it to you straight on the line
D (hold)
Either light up
A (hold)
or leave me
E
alone

JAM (E) or (E,G,A,B)
