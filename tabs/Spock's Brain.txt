Mike sings these lines over these arpegios

I was standing on the runway
I was running to the standby
Never understand why I stood by the standby waiting for the standby

I was standing on the runway    Trey: He was askin' for it anyway
I was running to the standby
Never understand why I stood by the standby waiting for the standby

You can't hide
You can't hide

I am not sure about all of the lyrics here

Go ahead and triffle me
Give me a ticket and lie to me
????????????????????me was harder
Go outside and visit the ground
Imagine ??????crash in the ground
About to smash in the mouth

The plane
You're gettin' ready for the plane on time
The plane
You're gettin' ready for the plane on time
