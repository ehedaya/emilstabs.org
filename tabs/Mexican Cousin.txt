   C              G                   F    C       F  C
Oh Tequila I turn to you like a long lost friend
          F               C            G           C  G
I want to kiss my Mexican cousin once again
    F                 C         Am
We'll cover every emotion from happiness to sorrow
          G                Fm          Em                G 
and the conversations I forget you'll tell me about tomorrow
          Am                        Fm     Em     Dm
When the phone calls start, am I in bed or in a hearse?
    G                    F                         Em      Dm
The things you tell me about myself can't make me feel any worse, well
C                            F
I'm awful sorry you got pissed
C                              F
Just have to cross you off the list
            G
of my true friends...
[no chord]
and Tequila's where that starts and where it ends

                          C                      F
                        (Oooh)   Mexican cousin again (x4)
                          C                      F
(I wanna wanna kiss your oooh)   Mexican cousin again (x4)

Jam between C and F
