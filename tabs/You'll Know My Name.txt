This is in 3/4 time.
The chords are played with the root note (or 5th) picked on the 
first beat, and the chord strummed on the second and third beat.  
The only exception to this is where ever there is a G A B, those 
are the actual notes, G A and B played as low as possible, for a 
single beat each.

 [Intro] 

 G A B |C   |    |    |    |  

 [Verse] 

 C                   F            C    
 Oh, I guess you can stay here tonight
 C                               F            G     
 I'll pay for the breakfast when dark becomes light
 C                        F              
 But if for some reason I buy you a ring
 G                          G     A    B C     
 Don't get your hopes up it won't mean a thing.
 
 |C   |    |    |    |  

 C                            F          C     
 And then if I say what you'd rather not hear.
 C                        F        G
 Just let it flow out the opposite ear.
 C                          F              
 Most of my words are meant just for today
 G                                G      A    B C         
 And there's limited truth in the things that I say.
 
 |C    |C7   |     |

 [Chorus] 

 F                    C
 Nothing works as its written.
 F                         C
 Try to feed and you'll be bitten.
 F                        C      A7
 Try to practice what you read.
 D7                          G7        
 And more than likely you'll bleed.
 
 [Verse] 

 C                        F             C
 But none of this matters now that your here.
 C                               F           G
 You really can't leave till you finish that beer.
 C                       F
 Somewhere inside us our needs are the same. [Short Pause]
 G                              G      A    B  C
 The difference come morning is You'll know my name. 
 
 |C   |F   |C   |    |
