Here are the chords to Nellie Kane. Corrections welcome as I have never attempted
 to learn a song by ear before. This is from the "Hampton Comes Alive"
 version from 11-21-98. When playing the "D" chord, you should always be alternating
 the "D" and

 "A" bass note with each beat, eg: four beats per measure, one measure: D A D
 A..... Key of D Intro: D G D whole thing twice, listen to a recording A D for
 the timing

Verse:


D
As a young man I went riding out on the western plain

                                            Bm
In the state of North Dakota I met my Nellie Kane,

 A             D
I met my Nellie Kane


She was livin alone in a cabin with a son by another man
For five years she waited for him as long as a woman can,
As long as a woman can

Chorus:

       G                    D                  A               D
I Don't know what changed my mind, until then I was the ramblin kind

G                            D           A               D
The kind of love I can't explain, that I have for Nellie Kane

Page solos over the verse chords

She took me out to work that day and helped me til the land
In the afternoon we planted seed and in the evenin we held hands,
In the evenin we held hands

Her blue yes told me everything that you'd want to know
And it was then I realized that I would never go
I would never go

Chorus x1
then Trey solos over the verse chords

Now many years have gone by and our son has grown up tall
I became her guardian and she became my all,
She became my all


Outro is chorus plus one extra:

A                      D
That I have for Nellie Kane
