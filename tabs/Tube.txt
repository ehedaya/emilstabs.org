The song starts with the

D-----------
A-----------  into Am
E----3(b)--

on the Am you start with "Asteroid crashed, and nothing burned."

D--------
A---------  into Fm
E----3(b)

on the Fm Trey sing "It made me wonder..." (i don't know what this G, Gm9 is
all about)

Next you groove on F#m for the verse:

Do tigers sleep in lily patches?
Do rhinos run from thunder?
I got an ache in my left ear
I felt a twinge but I still could hear.
It made me think I would not be burned,
but rather give myself to

on "to science" you move down to F and you have:

    F             G         Ab      Am
To science, i felt that i could help

D-----------
A-----------  into Am
E----3(b)--

on the Am: "Paranoid the doctor ran"

D-----------
A-----------  into Fm
E----3(b)--

on the Fm: "Shouting his graphic translation"

Then you continue with F#m for the second verse:

All out of order
Gang wars and ails of riches,
Spewing forth their color
He purposely waited till I was done
To knock on the lavatory door
Accusing me of ruining the fun,
 F        G         Ab        Am
He knocked on it some more
 F         G                Ab            Am
The fun, He knocked on it some more.

The A7, D7 jam
they go into 3/4 and drop into F#m.  Then they
slide up to G#m,
and then hit

D-----------
A-----------  into Am
E----3(b)--

"Alloyed suitors drawn  inside"

D-----------
A-----------  into Fm
E----3(b)--

"An apple or a grape"

F#m(3rd verse):

To put forth a cloud of Mercury
In front of a mighty car
On a freeway in Los Angeles
Once the spraying has been done'
Cause there's more pain from necessity
You're a portrait of your past,
There's a mummy in the cabinet.
Are there no more arrows left?
What's that rubber bottle doing here?
How's that napkin for a proof
Ten cents to a dollar now
For a shelf of pregnant ears
Robert Palmer is applauded
again, s'again, s'again

     F                 G      Ab    Am
So stupendous, living in this tube.

Another Attempt:
From: ethein@unix.amherst.edu (Mondo Mando)

Over Spring Break, I tried to figure out Tube on the old geetar.  I got
most of it but there's one chord that eludes me.  To open the song, they
hit an A minor over "An asteroid crashed, and nothing burned," and then
some kind of extension off of the G chord for "It made me wonder."  My
question is this: what is that second chord?  The closest I can come is
Gm(9) but that is definitely not what they play.  Can someone help? The
rest of the song goes as follows: Groove in F#m under the verse until
"But rather give myself to science."  On the word science, they drop
into F.

Then we have...
  F            G          Ab      Am
To science, I thought that I could help

Repeat that, then do the same thing for the second verse.  The first
part of Page's solo is over A7.  The second part is over A7 and D7, like
the jam in Julius.  Then for Trey's solo, they go into 3/4 and drop into
F#m.  Then they slide up to G#m, and then hit Am to go into the last
verse.  That's really all there is to it.  The hard part is singing it!
It's soooooo wierd! If anyone figures out that wierd G chord, let me
know.

Lyrics from Phish.net:


An asteroid crashed and nothing burned
It made me wonder
Do tigers sleep in lily patches?
Doctor, mine does run for thunder.
I got an ache in my left ear
I felt the truth but I still could hear.
Made me think, I would not be burned,
but rather give myself to science,
I felt that I could help
To science, I felt that I can help

Paranoid the doctor ran,
Shouting his graphic translation
All out of order
Gang wars and ails of riches,
Spewing forth their color
He purposely waited till I was done
To knock on the lavatory door
Accusing me of ruining the fun,
He knocked on it some more
The fun, He knocked on it some more.

And alloy suitors were all inside
An apple or a grape
To put forth a cloud of Mercury
In front of a mighty car
On a freeway in Los Angeles
Once the spraying has been done
'Cause there's more pain from necessity
You're a portrait of your past,
There's a mummy in the cabinet.
Are there no more arrows left?
What's that rubber bottle doing here?
How's that napkin for a proof
Ten cents to a dollar now
For a shelf of pregnant ears
Robert Palmer is applauded
again, again, again
So stupendous, living in this tube.
