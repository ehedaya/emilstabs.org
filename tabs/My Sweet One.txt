[Chorus]
E                  A                 E
My sweet one, I'll call you my sweet one
A                         E
You're my only true sweet one
A                                   E
With my all, I'll call you my sweet one
E                   A        E
From far away, I'll say your name

Oh with you, I'd travel thick
And with you, I'd also travel thin
And all the spaces in between
I'd travel with you You're my sweet one

A                                                  E              A       E
But for now I must sit here and ponder the yonder
A                                                       B
Herbivores ate well cause their food didn't never run

[Chorus]
[Solos over Chorus]

A
Oh, if You're ever unsatisfied with the way life's treating You
E
You know You can count on me to take good care of You
A
I love you honey oh yes I do You know that's true of course
B (stop)
And if your dog or cat ever dies, I'll buy You an Ewe

[Chorus with modified last line (play slower):]
A           B                        A         E
From far away, I'll say your [pause] naaaaaaaaame
