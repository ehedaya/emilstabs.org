From: David Douglas McCallum <kcjonz@wam.umd.edu>

Sanity has been played in Ab since 97'. Don't know what sparked the changed, but just play everything down half a step down on your guitar. David did a great job of tabbing this great song out! Just a note, it's not your tuner!!

A            E
Sanity never came my way.                               (Came his way)
A            E
Sanity never came my way.                               (His way)
 A                    E
I don't know what I'll do today.                        (Way)
      A            E
'Cause sanity never came my way.

A                   E
Lost my mind just a couple of times.                    (Lost his mind)
A                   E
Lost my mind just a couple of times.                    (His mind)
       A                           E
You can spend your nickels, you can spend your dimes.   (Mind)
     A                   Em7 (dirty)     Bm7
But I lost my mind just a couple of times.

Em7      Bm7      Em7      Bm7     Em7     F#    C    D    E

Then the little single-note phrase:

E------------------------------
B--12-11-10--------------------
G----------12-13-9------9-8-9--
D------------------11-9--------
A------------------------------
E------------------------------

The same pattern continues for the other verses...

The band played this song in G# instead of A; so just move all the chords above down half a step!
