    Minor edit to main theme from Andrew Russell


Main theme:
e---------5p3-----3-------3------------------|
B-------3-----------5p3-----3p0----0---------|
G-----0---------0-------0--------0---2p0-----|
D--------------------------------------------|
A--------------------------------------------|
E--------------------------------------------|

The main theme is played over all parts unless otherwise noted.  
I am doing this from memory so some parts may be off.



All the way home we felt we had a chance
                                     A
To review the coulds before we were born

   D                       <main theme>
And to invite a new game of can'ts




Absorbed in the clouds a voice from afar said
                                                 A
"With the right device you can make a pattern grow
D                         <main theme>
 Or you can tune up your car"

So we stayed on the train admiring the time
                                  A
As the lights of the city drew near
D                   <main theme>
 We drank a little wine

They were blurry and green outer space in between
With a depth and a form unclear
Then we saw it up ahead

[Use these chords for this part]

A flickering lantern lit up on the tracks
Bb6?                     Am7                <main theme x2>
   In the rocks that had covered up the bridge

        D              G/D  
From the banks of a river to the bed

Am/D
   Of the valley upstream to the place we live


(continue this pattern until outtro which is basically
just variations of the main theme
The glass on the lantern cast back the sight
Of a drive-in movie we drove by below
We saw where we'd been in the pictures within
Projecting all the places we would go
So we follow the scene and flowed up your steps
To a smooth wooden floor in a trance
The train whistle melody wove through the trees
And in through the door to signal the turns of a dance
