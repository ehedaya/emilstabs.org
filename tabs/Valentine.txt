[Intro]
B   C#m    A
                  Hey!
B   C#m    A
------------
       B       
And we spin in circles
C#m                     A
Walk in a straight line
[Repeat x3]
-------------
B
   Silence, dark and long
       C#m             A
And the thunder clap   splits the night
B
   And I'm standing in this field
C#m                    A
Storms are all around me
B
All through the sky, 
      C#m                  A
I see strings of electricity
B
   And I feel the power,
C#m                        A
Like it could burn my hands

D#m                         B
   Up above, the clouds are moving
     E             F#m
When suddenly, the rain is all around me
F#m                         G
Like sheets of glass, coming down from the sky
E                             A
Every drop is there to guide, every drop is there to guide
  Am       C                             B
Release, release, the ropes around your neck

B   C#m    A
------------
       B       
And we spin in circles
C#m                     A
Walk in a straight line
[Repeat x2]
-------------
B   C#m    A

C#
Jagged beams of light, explode and dance in the darkness around me
And I can reach out and touch the beams, and the light turns solid
And it wraps around my wrist

B
One makes a loop, 
C#m                  A
     a thousand more follow
B
A thousand more follow til my arms are surrounded,
     C#m                   A
by a conical web of light
B
My arms in the eyes of a web of light
     C#m                   A
A tornado of light beams
B
And I feel the pulling, and start to rise,
    C#m           A
And every beam is there to guide
E                                                           Bb
Release, release, release, release, the ropes around your neck

Bb     Cm      Ab
-----------------
       Bb
And we spin in circles
Cm                       Ab
Walk in a straight line 
[Repeat x2]
-----------------
B
And we spin in circles
C#m          A
[Solo and jam over B, C#m, A progression to end]
