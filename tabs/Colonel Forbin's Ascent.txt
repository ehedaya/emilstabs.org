This transcription is pretty close.  The two chords at the end of the verse are tough to hear.  I feel like the melody  notes are D and C#, that's why I called it C#7b9--F#7.
I don't think Trey plays Gmaj7 during the choruses, but I like the way they sound.  (Page might play the major 7ths there)  The verses are very unique in that Trey sings
a straight-forward melody, but with very non-traditional chords behind it.  The instrumental bridge is another example of Trey taking a line and modulating it around
almost seamlessly.  (Golgi, Bowie, Horn are other examples)

Colonel Forbin's Ascent

by Phish
Transcribed by Emil Hedaya ( emil@liii.com )
There is one part that Trey plays (Oh, the sacred Creed will be yours . . ) which he picks 
with the open E string:

  and his bloodshot eyes saw all the lay between him and fulfillment of his vow
        Db7                           Gbm7  
  And he felt his fingers wrap around a knotted root
 
      B                            E
