"Terrapin" by Syd Barret, "The Madcap Laughs"

E                  G
I really love you, and I mean you;

E                   G       A
The star above you, crystal blue;

D               E                  A         C G
Well oh baby my hairs on end about you... 

	

E                    G
I shouldn't see you, though I'd love to;

E                G     A
I fly above you, yes I do;

D              E                  A         C G
But oh baby my hairs on end about you...

	

A                                                                        C G... Bb E...
Floating, bumping, noses dodge, a tooth, the fins, a luminou-ou-ous...

A
Fangs, all-round, the clown, is dark, below, the boulders hiding, all the;

C                     G     E
sunlight's, good, for us!



E                       G
Cause we're the fishes, and all we do...

E               G         A
The move about, is all we do...

D              E                  A
But oh baby my hairs on end about you....
