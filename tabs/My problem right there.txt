                 D:--6-------4--6-----

This vamp is repeated around 4 times depending on the performance, listen to a recording for timing.

Verse: 
G#                                    C#            G#
Didnt get no sleep last night, I was thinkin about today
G#                                  D#
I try to keep things simple, but my brain gets in the way
Fm                  C#       C#                   D#
I say you need to rest now, but my big head dont care
C# (let ring)
now i can see that that's gonna be my problem right there

Chorus:
G#                         C#             G#
My problem right there, my problem right there  
G#                     D#
My powerful mind is my problem right there      
Fm                    C#           C#         D#
But i've got no other problems, of which i'm aware
C# (let ring)
I'm just too damn smart, thats my problem right there 

repeat intro, or solo over intro/verse, whatever.

Verse 2:
now peaches from tulsa, is callin again
i remember the time i went home with her friend
now they both say they're comin, to be by my side
ain't no room in this truck to take three for a ride

Chorus 2:
my problem right there, my problem right there
these women 'round here, are my problem right there
and i could handle them all, but they dont like to share
i've got too much love, that's my problem right there

Bridge:
D#                             G#
Now i can stay up all night, no problem okay  
D#                         G#
But i'm often inclined, to sleep through the day      
Fm                   C#         C#      D# (on the Charleston recording they held this note and did the intro
in the shade of the heat i can nap anywhere                                  vamp (in D#) once or twice here)
C#
now i can see that that's gonna be a problem right there

Chorus 3:
my problem right there, my problem right there
brains women and sleep are my problem right there
just look what this cap has done done to my hair
(mike:) looks like you got one more problem right there

Here Page and Trey just traded solos over the verse chords for a while before going back into the intro vamp>verse

Verse 3:
now i drank the last pull, from my best corn liquor
got nothing to eat but this half melted snicker         __
and the bills they keep coming, quicker and quicker       \
that old bill collector he gets slicker and slicker        \
mister policeman is looking for me                          \  these lines all just repeat the Fm - C# - D# pattern,
and i've got this strange rash, aint no sting from a bee    /  and hit the C# on the last line, letting it ring like
but i've got no other problems, of which i'm aware       __/   the previous verses
since i've lost everything, and i dont really care

Chorus 4:
my problem right there, my problem right there                 
these problems right here are my problem right there
and they'll keep on coming, till i stop breathing AIRRRRR
then thats gonna be, my biggest problem right there

Refrain:
G#                         C#             G#
My problem right there, my problem right there  x 3 or however many times
