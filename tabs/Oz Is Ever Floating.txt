  Oz Is Ever Floating by Oysterhead 
             Transcribed by Dough 

The main chords in the song are D C G F which sound good pretty much everywhre but open 
 
the intro is just Trey playing different variations and inversions of those chords he also add some licks that are easy to
figure out by simply screwing around with the D blues scale

D                           C                    G
Oz is always floating ever drifting somethimes doting 
D                       C               G            F
Oh the things that mean the world to Dr. John     C. Lilly 

these are the only chord changes in the song so im not gonna take the 
time to repeat it with the other lyrics
