The Birdwatcher is an A Cappella barbershop quartet song.<br>
The studio version on Party Time has occasional percussive chimes,<br>
but these are not present when performed live.<br>


Da dooooo, da-dum
Da dooooo, da-dum (Birdwatcher)

Thesba called me on the phone,
he had a case of colic.
I told him it was cause he was,
a rubbing alcoholic.

Drempkin was so proud he was,
such a great romancer.
Til I said the world could use,
one less beer belly-dancer.

Mel Katain was pregnant,
and she'd heard all the expressions:
It's just a hot flash, or, 
or else those fire-breathing lessons

I sleep I dream, I dream I sleep,
but sometimes dreaming is too deep.
If I could shed one layer now,
I still would be asleep somehow.

Da dooooo, da-dum (Cause I'm the birdwatcher)
Da dooooo, da-dum

Thesba called me on the phone,
he had a case of colic. (Fighting fire with fire!)
I told him it was cause he was,
a rubbing alcoholic. (Now he's hitting the sauce!)

Drempkin was so proud he was,
such a great romancer. (He's always watching the birds!)
Til I said the world could use,
one less beer belly-dancer.

Mel Katain was pregnant,
and she'd heard all the expressions:
It's just a hot flash, or, 
or else those fire-breathing lessons

I sleep I dream, I dream I sleep,
but sometimes dreaming is too deep.
If I could shed one layer now,
I still would be asleep somehow.
