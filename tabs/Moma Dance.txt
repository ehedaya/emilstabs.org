G#7 (1m) slide to G7 (hold 1m)


F#7 funk jam (16m)   Trey plays:

Cm7 Funk jam (through lyrics until noted)


After jam chill the improv and:

All throughout I gaze and glimpse you
Nothing ever did convince you
See you when you're all alone
It's not the person, I'm not known
The moment ends although I feel winds
Blowing differently then ever before
And they're pushing me further from shore


The moment ends though I feel winds   (4x Fish, 4x Fish + Trey)


Cm7
The moment ends the moment ends
F9                                      (4x)
The moment ends the moment ends


Cm7 Funk (8m, then 8m with Fish whispering something)


(Trey)
Up the rail, taking sail
Mind the skipper will not fail             (2x, 2nd time 'rail' is
He'll bring out wine it will be fine       rigging)
Just heed the order, watch the sail


The moment ends though I feel winds  (8x like above)


Cm7
The moment ends the moment ends
F9                                      (4x)
The moment ends the moment ends


Cm7 Funk jam w/ Trey singing solo (at least at first)

Solo

|--build-up------------|   * this is that 'soaring' bend note
E|---------------------------------------------------|
B|-------------------------8--10bb--10-8-10--8----8--|
G|---------------8----8h10---------------------10----|
D|--------8h9h10---10--------------------------------|
A|-8h9h10--------------------------------------------|
E|---------------------------------------------------|

E|--------------------------------------|
B|-8-x-8/6------8-----------------------|
G|---------8/10---10-8-10--8------------|
D|---------------------------10p8h10-10-|
A|--------------------------------------|
E|--------------------------------------| 

also, experiment with moving it up a step or more, and
change around which note is the 'soaring bend.' 10th fret
on high E works well too.



F7 (1m) slide to E7 hold (1m)


Eb7 Funk (3m) Eb7 D7 C#7 C7

B7

That's it! I checked the lyrics with 7/17 so they're pretty close, if
you can help with the rigging/river thing or anything else e-mail me</pre>

It grooves off of this for a while then moves to the same pattern in F minor
(7th fret of b string) with variations
throughout, it breaks down into a little solo then moves into this same
pattern in C minor (13th fret of b string)                           If you
don't have a 5-string then you'll have to stick to the album version which is
all in C minor. If you do have the 5 try keeping all of the positions on the
b-string for that extra fat bottom end

I'll try to transcribe the breakdown and give a general idea about the solo
but it's hard without my bass in my hands.
