C                      G/B
 It makes no diff'rence where I turn
Em            G/D              Am7
 I can't get over you and the flame still burns
C                          G/B
 It makes no diff'rence,   night or day
Em           G/D            Am7
 The shadow never seems to fade away
Am7/D    G  Em7     C    D         G   C
 And the sun don't shine   anymore
G           Em7      C   D         G   C    G
 And the rains fall down on my doorG
  Now there's no love
Dm
  As true as the love
C                     A7
  That dies untold
           G    Em7            C   D    G     C    G
  But the clouds never hung so low    beforeIt makes no diff'rence how far I go
Like a scar the hurt will always show
It makes no diff'rence who I meet
They're just a face in the crowd
On a dead-end street
And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door
These old love letters
Well, I just can't keep
'Cause like the gambler says
Read 'em and weep
And the dawn don't rescue me no more
D                   Bm
 Without your love   I'm nothing at all
C                   Cm
 Like an empty hall  it's a lonely fall
D                   Bm
 Since you've gone   it's a losing battle
C
 Stampeding cattle
      Am              D
 They rattle the walls
And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door
Well, I love you so much
It's all I can do
Just to keep myself from telling you
That I never felt so alone before
