     Greetings,
   
    Here are some additions to Wilson.  This is actually a really cool tune
    with a couple key changes.  I tried to get the chords to match the lyrics
    but listen to the song for better timing.
   
   
    E-E                E-E
       Wilson             Wilson
   
    E-E                E-E
       Wilson             Wilson
   
    E            C                A               E
    Oh out near  Stonehenge,      I lived alone
   
    E           C                 A               E

    When we had that meeting, over down near Game  (Hendge)
   
    A            D                E          E
    Wilson,      King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
   
    A            D                E (hold and feedback)

    E            C               A               E
   
   
    E            C               A (hold and feed back)
   
   
    E               C        A                   E          
    You got me back thinkin' that your the worst one
   
   
    E                       G                  A
    I must inquire, Wilson, can you still have fun
   
    E                       G                  A
    Oh Wilson,              can you still have fun
   
    Repeat a couple time then hold and feedback the A, and use a spacey
    or "swirling" effect.  Trey often uses his Digitech Whammy pedal in
    conjunction with tremolo or univibe.
   
    Blap! Boom ....... (I still don't know what Trey says here :)
   
    Solo 4 and Outro
   
    E            C               A               E
   
    The above repeats however many times you want to keep the jam going
    then ends with:
   
   
    E            C               A (hold and feedback)              
   
   
    The most parts of the solos can be figured out by using the first
    position of the minor Pentatonic scale the key of the chords the
    passages start in:
   
    Solo 1:  First Position Bm Pentatonic (7th fret)
    Solo 2:  First Position Am Pentatonic (5th fret)
    Solo 3:  First Position Fm Pentatonic (1st fret)
    Solo 4:  First Position Em Pentatonic (12th fret)
   
    1st Position B Minor Pentatonic
   
    fret    E   A   D   G   B   E
