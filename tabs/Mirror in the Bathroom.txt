Verse 
[E]                       [G]
Mirror in the bathroom please talk free
[E]                  [G]       [A]
The door is locked  just you and me.
Can I take you to a restaurant  that's got glass tables
You can watch yourself while you are eating.

[Sax solo 1...same thing for guitar as in verse.]

[Sax solo 2... the guitar interlude }

Mirror in the bathroomI just can't stop it,
Every Saturday you see mewindow shopping.
Find no interestin the racks and shelves
Just ten thousand reflections of my own sweet self, self, self...

[Sax solo]

Mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom...

Mirror in the bathroom  Recompense
For all my crimesof self defense.
Cures you whisper make no sense
Drift gently into mental illness.

Mirror in the bathroom please talk free
The door is locked just you and me.
Can I take you to a restaurant that's got glass tables
You can watch yourself while you are eating.

Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom...
