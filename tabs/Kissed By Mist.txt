((Intro
Bb Bb, Bb Bb, C  x2


C                         
The forest seemed to swallow us
Bb                    Am         Am > G > F
Your hand was holding tight
F                  C
We walked together several miles
Bb                 Am            Am > G > F         
And fading was the light

C#               G#
So softly then I heard a voice
F#               E
You seemed to hear it too
G#             B
Then walked on resolutely like
F#                  G
It wasn't meant for you

Bb Bb, Bb Bb, C  x2

C
But when it came again I stopped
Bb                  Am           Am > G > F      
The voice among the trees
F                    C
Came flowing sweetly louder now
Bb                   Am          Am > G > F
In tones designed to please

C#               G#
Again you pulled upon my arm,
F#                  E
"You have to listen now"
G#                  B
And as you spoke, a chill went through me,
F#          G
Freezing me somehow

((The same chord pattern repeats throughout virtually 
((the entire song.  

"The woodland folk and forest creatures living in this glade,
Have asked me to bring people here for this I am well paid
The silent song will capture you, enrapture you and then,
You'll grow roots and bark and leaves, and I'll bring back more men"

"But why", I asked, not quite aware of what was going on,
I saw your movements move urgently, but words were drowned in song
"You are different though", she said, "you have something to say,
It was a big mistake to take you here, let's run away."

((There's a little solo here, it's all chords, and it's
((all the same chords as above, but you'll have to figure out the 
((fingering yourself, cause I don't know them all, and even if I did, 
((I don't have the patience to tab out the whole thing!

I tried to run, but couldn't, my head was bathed in sound,
And I looked down and saw my legs two feet beneath the ground.
My toes were roots, my fingers twigs, my skin was scaley bark
And as into an oak I changed, I watched you in the dark

Completing your transaction with the nebulous green crowd,
Of tiny dancing forest people, singing very loud.
A celebration for a tree, and then I understood,
My initial feelings in this melancholy wood

I know I felt the change in you, when we finally kissed,
I looked but you were surrounded by, a tapestry of mist

I picture you, as wind blows through our leaves and over land,
Every tree that stands with me for money changing hands.
