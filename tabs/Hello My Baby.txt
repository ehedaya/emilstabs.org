This song is performed acapella, so there is no tablature.  If someone would like to transcribe the vocals, that would be interesting.


Lyrics:

Tell me that I'm your own, my baby.

Hello my baby, hello my honey,

Hello my ragtime summertime gal, 

Send me a kiss by (Fish: Wire [hold for a short while, listen to a recording for more]),

By wire, baby my heart's on fire on fire.

If you refuse me, honey you'll lose me,

Then you'll be left alone oh baby,

Telephone and tell me, tell me,

Tell my I'm your very own!  Ohhh

Repeat.
