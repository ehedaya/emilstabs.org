Verse 2 (same chords):

I know a queen who loved me for a week
Said more from one through four by seven she would hardly speak but through
Words in a book she never let me see
Stashed ahigh up on my shelf but never make me doubt myself until

Inside I see a tiny piece of me
Spread out on the pages I once knew
Lawlessness abounds just listen to the sounds
As the night speaks to a woman I once knew

Quick Lick: (this is mostly from trying it from memory, but I think this is
how it begins at least)
E-----------------------------------------------------
B-----------------------------------------------------
G--9-7-9-7-------------7-4--------------5-2-----------
D----------9-7-----5-7-----7-5------3-5-----5-3-------
A-------------9--7-------------7--5-------------5/7---
E-----------------------------------------------------
haven't tried the second lick, but i think its pretty close to the first one
only over D, like I said, I'm too lazy to go back and listen closely, but
this should be a start.
Hope that sounds right, better than nothing:) Have fun
