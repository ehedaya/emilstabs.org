Interesting history to this song.  Thanks to Joe Woltering.


This song is a really wierd blues formation - 9 bars? Maybe I counted
it out wrong.

Anyhow, the words are:


Got a bird what whistle, baby got a bird, honey got a birdie would sing

Baby got a bird, honey got a birdie would sing

Without m©≠ Corrina, sure don©≠t mean, sure don©≠t mean a natural thing

I learned to love you, baby ®fo I call, honey ®fo I call your name

Baby ®fo I call, honey ®fo I call your name

I wouldn©≠ trade your love for money, honey you©≠re my warm heart,
  baby you©≠re my love light thang

Have mercy, have mercy, baby on my hard luck, honey on my hard luck soul

Baby on my hard luck, honey on my hard luck soul

I got a rainbow round my shoulder, look like silver, baby shine like Klondike gold




-organ jam-

-first verse-

Corrina...   Corrina...
