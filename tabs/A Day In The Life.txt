About a lucky man who made the grade

Well I just had to laugh

I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car / He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared / They'd seen his face before
Em                                                 C....
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today oh boy / The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away / But I just had to look
Having read the book....

C            Bm       G       Am7    Em
I'd love to turn.... you.... on....

Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head
E
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
E                                                          A
Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat
E
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

C   G   D   C   E   C   G   D   C
Ahhh....
E D C D G

I heard the news today oh boy / Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small / They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn... you... on...</pre>
