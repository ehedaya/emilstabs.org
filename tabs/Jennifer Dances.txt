G                                        C             D        G
The workers have comeback from their day in the field
G                          C                D          G        
Jennifer dances and she cooks me a meal
G                         C          D              G D  
A little less salt in the gravy tonight    

G                               C           D
You oughtta know from long ago to listen to the winds that blow
G                                           C                   D
'Cause when the past creeps up at last you'll see the landscape open fast
G                               C               D
And you'll be standing on a landing stumbling despite your demanding
G                               C               D
A little less salt in the gravy tonight


C
You always knew  
D
the winds that blew
G                                       C          D
The workers have come back from their day in the field   (over and over)


And drawn inside a valley wide you cross it with a single stride



You always knew

The winds that blew

The workers have comeback from their day in the field (3x)



You always knew

The winds that blew



The workers have comeback from their day in the field

(Jennifer dances)

(3x)



Jennifer dances...
