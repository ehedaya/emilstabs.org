Don't want to be an actor, pretending on the stage
Don't want to be a writer, with my thoughts out on the page
Don't want to be a painter, 'cause everyone comes to look
Don't want to be anything where my life's an open book

  A dream, it's true     but I'd see it through

If I could be (if I could be) wasting my time with you.
Don't want to be a farmer, working in the sun
Don't want to be an outlaw, always on the run
Don't want to be a climber, reaching for the top
Don't want to be anything where I don't know when to stop

A dream, it's true   but I'd see it through
If I could be (if I could be) wasting my time with you.
