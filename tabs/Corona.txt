[Intro]
B

A     E      B
Where is the light
A    E    B
that I    find
     A    E    B
from time to   time?

A         E          B
No matter where it's drawn
A   E     B 
I stumble on
    A    E    B
And fall down hard

         A               E              B
When the sunspots all combusted And the ozone layer burns
     A              E             B
When all of this is over, and the hydrogen returns
A             E    B
How you gonna see, how you gonna know?
A              E                B
Will we stay together, when the molten plasma flows

        A           E              B
When corona touches ocean, and the judgement comes at last
     A              E              B
When all of this is over, and the future meets the past
A            E                B
Suddenly the sky is gone, the stars are out tonight
    A             E            B
But how you gonna see, 'til you swear you hold on tight?

[repeat previous verse, backup vocals singing first verse]

         A               E              B
When the sunspots all combusted And the ozone layer burns
     A              E
When all of this is over.
