Trey's 6 STG. Dreadnaught

This guitar is a very unique combination of woods. The sides and back are made of Quilted Hon. Mahogany, the top is Larch, the bridge and bindings are made of Flamed Maple, and the rossette and headcap are also of Quilted Mahogany. The neck is Hon. Mahogany and the fingerboard is ebony.

This particular instrument is now owned and operated by Trey Anastasio, lead guitar player with that little ol' band from Burlington, Vermont known as PHISH. I was backstage after a show in Gainesville, Fla. a couple of years ago and met Trey for the first time. When we met, he hugged me, told me he had the guitar on the bus and that he was playing it all the time. That was all the compliment that I needed.

As most "Phish Fans" know, Paul Languedoc(The band's Soundman) makes the electric guitars and basses that Trey and Mike Gordon(Bassplayer) use onstage when they are on tour. I now know Paul personally and I have the utmost respect for the work he does on tour and in the building shop.
