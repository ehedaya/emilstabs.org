transcribed by Mike in Japan

Verse (4 measures for each chord listed)

C     G     D     Em

C     G     D     D

Em    Em    C     C


play that verse 2 times, which leads right into the chorus
which is...

G     F     C     C

after a little of that, they'll go Em -> C two times, then back into the chorus chords which are repeated through the rest of the song and soloed over

Enjoy.

|  G  |   G  |

C                 G
Happy happy oh my friend
                 D
Blow out candles once again
                   Em 
Leave the presents all inside
Em    D   C              G
Take  my  hand and letâ€™s take a ride    
                   D           Dsus   D  
Backwards down the number line
                         Em
You were eight and I was nine
                          D        
Do you know what happened then?
(A)(B) C                             
        Do you know why we're still friends
                        G
Laughing all these many years
                            D
We pushed through hardships tasted tears
               Em 
Made a promise one to keep    
Em D C                      G
      I can still recite it in my sleep
             D                Dsus   D  
Every time a birthday comes
                            Em
Call your friend and sing a song               
           D    C
Or whisper it into his ear
                                    G
Or write it down, just don't miss a year


Chorus 1: (played 4x through)

    F              C
You decide what it contains
                          G
How long it goes but this remains
         F          C
The only rule is it begins
                  G                   
Happy happy oh my friend


Chorus 2: (play 2x, starting after the 2nd time through "Chorus 1" above)
    F      C                               G
And all my friends come backwards down the number line x3


Bridge:

Em  C

Em  C

Em                        C
And when I see you coming down the line with eyes wide open
Em                                C
Somewhere in between the past and future, where you drift in time
                        D        G
You can see a different point of view

Repeat Chorus 2x

Jam

Repeat Chorus 



bass solo transcribed for guitar (thru the piano...don't have a bass)and repositioned it an octave above mike's bass due the guitar not having the range on the deeper octave notes like a bass.  hope that makes sense.
