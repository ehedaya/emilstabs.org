G
I've been worked by the rain    
D/F#
Driven by the snow
Em                C
Drunk and dirty - don't you know
        G      C  D  C   G
But I'm still..          ..willin

            G
(And I was) Out on the road

Late at night 
Em                      C
Seen my pretty Alice in every headlight

Alice..           ..Dallas Alice


CHORUS:
G                C              D
And I been from  Tucson to Tucumcari

Tehachapi to Tonapa
G                                         C
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
C                                       D        D/F#
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed

Weed, Whites and wine
G                 D
And you show me a sign 
D       G       C  D  C       G
I'll be willin'         to be movin'


KICK ASS PIANO SOLO


G
Kicked by the wind
D/F#
Robbed by the sleet
       Em                     C
Had my head stoved in but I'm still on my feet
        G     C  D  C  G
And I'm still ....     in a whole lot of trouble

G                         D/F#
Smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Em
Baked by the sun
C                  G
Every time I go to Mexico
C  D  C           G
          And I'm still....
