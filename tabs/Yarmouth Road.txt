G#m                     A      
I dig a deep hole, bees buzzing all around
      E             
But I know you'll be happy
         B                       G#m 
That I'm pouring concrete on the ground

G#m                A
Hoist up posts and beams erratically
E                        B
Garden plot's beautiful, painter gets at it
      G#m                      A             G#m
But I guess I should've checked with you somehow

G#                         Eb               Bbm       Db
Thought I could get you to come to Yarmouth Road
G#                     Eb                Bbm          Db
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb
G#                       Eb                Bbm        Db
All I ever wanted you to do was to come on home
G#                     Eb                Bbm          Db
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb

G#m                          A
I filled up the shelves with funny books to laugh to
E                          B
Lazy Susan has some of the mocha rings that you love
G#m                             A                          G#m
Registered our names so they'll know where to bring us our mail

G#m                    A
Couldn't find flat wax for all the mahogany
E                  B
Didn't we see some walking through a trade show
G#m                   A               G#m
Does any of this even start to ring a bell?

G#                         Eb               Bbm       Db
Thought I could get you to come to Yarmouth Road

F#              Db     Eb     Fm
when we need to roam

Fm                 Eb
Blind faith stings hastily
Fm                       
My faith brings me right to the flower shop
    Eb                        Bbm                            F#                Db
I'd like that bouquet please, wrap some of those extra green things around the stems
  F#                             G#m
A little card to write on if you have them

G#m                     A
Candles are lit all the red napkins folded
E                 B
Pecan pie wafting fumes from the oven
G#m                             A         G#m
Turn off all the ringers on the phones

G#m                     A
Look out the window see headlights passing by
E                           B
Maybe I don't see you and I don't really know why
G#m                       A                G#m
Don't make me feel like a guest in our own home
