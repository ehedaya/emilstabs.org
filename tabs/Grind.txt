This song is acapella, so there is no tablature.  If someone wants to transcribe the vocals, though, that would be interesting.  --[[User:Admin|Emil]] 21:56, 3 Apr 2005 (EDT)

side note (from Tony Hume - Orlando, FL)
"Grind" is one of the four tunes recorded for "Billy Breathes" but did not make it on the final cut.  Strange Design, Weekly Time also were recorded.  Grind was a 28 second song, with Trey's voice and solo guitar.

Grind

By Trey Anastasio and Tom Marshall

Grind, Grind, Grind, Grind, Grind, Grind, Griiiiiiiind

I can bend

in 68 Ways

And I, 

I have lived for twelve-thousand days

28 Teeth inside of my head

Grind 3 types of things 

And I'm sad that they're dead

Ba-Da-Da etc

Repeat
