(Here also, Mike uses the root notes of the chords, but does complicated things)

F             C                 Bb             F
How could you know that I lived in a desperate world?
How could you dream that we were all made out of stone?
What is the truth, what is the faithful lasting proof?
What is the central theme to this everlasting spoof?

F                    Eb
Knock on my windows, link up the chains

Bb                     F
It's gotta be easy, no splinters no pain

F                          Eb
It's Cadillac rainbows and lots of spaghetti

Bb                          C
And I love meatballs so you better be ready

(Mike's bassline goes essentially back to the intro)

F                     Bb              F
I'm going down to the central part of town
I'm going down to the central part of town
Central part of town, I'm going down
I'm going down to the central part of town

["Halley's Comet" over doo-wop, as in the first section]

F                  Bb               F
What did I do? And don't be blamin' eat my cashew

F
For everything I do to get the story

Bb                     F
And everything I do to pull me in

F
And everything I say to get the title

   Bb                     F
But when they use it on me I reject it

F              C         Bb
What would you do if you ate my daddy's shoes?
What would you say if it was naturally for you?
How would you feel if it rained on ???
How would you like to have your thick strawberry goo?

(Same as "Knock on my windows . . .)
I'm sinking down, it's a glorious feeling
To make a big difference, my body is reeling
Even Carl Sagan can't shine my shoes
`Cause I know deep inside he's got some mighty fine blues.


F                     Bb              F
I'm going down to the central part of town
I'm going down to the central part of town
I'm going down to the central part of town
I'm going down to the central part of ...

Jam modulates from:

Fm > Gm > Am > Bm > C#m




["Halley's Comet" over doo-wop]
[sounds like 'bee chiu ba ba b'jingo']

Halley's Comet, I-said-a Halley's Comet (2x)
Halley's Comet (4x)

Halley's Comet, I-said-a Halley's Comet (2x)

How could you know that I lived in a desperate world?
How could you dream that we were all made out of stone?
What is the truth, what is the faithful lasting proof?
What is the central theme to this everlasting spoof?

Knock on my windows, link up the chains
It's gotta be easy, no splinters no pain
It's Cadillac rainbows and lots of spaghetti
And I love meatballs so you better be ready

I'm going down to the central part of town
I'm going down to the central part of town
Central part of town, I'm going down
I'm going down to the central part of town

What did I do? And don't be blamin' eat my cashew (kazoo?)
For everything I do to get the story
And everything I do to pull me in
And everything I say to get the title
But when they use it on me I reject it

What would you do if you ate my daddy's shoes?
What would you say if it was naturally for you?
How would you feel if it rained on ???
How would you like to have your thick strawberry goo?

I'm sinking down, it's a glorious feeling
To make a big difference, my body is reeling
*Even ??? can't shine my shoes (Bob Seger? Tom Seaver?)
*'Cause I know deep inside it's got to ??? (mighty fine something)

I'm going down to the central part of town
I'm going down to the central part of town
I'm going down, central part of town
I'm going down to the central part of town
