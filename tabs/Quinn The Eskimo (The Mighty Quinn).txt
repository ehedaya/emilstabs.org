E           A                E             A
Ev'rybody's building the big ships and the boats,
E                 A
Some are building monuments,
E                       A
Others are jotting down notes,
E                A
Ev'rybody's in despair,
E                 A
Ev'ry girl and boy
         E                B
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
A                            E
Ev'rybody's [gonna] jump for joy.
     E                 B            E
     Come all without, come all within,
            E       B                A      E
     You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.


Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I likes my sugar sweet,
But guarding fumes and making haste, *)
It ain't my cup of meat.
Ev'rybody's just standin' round 'neath the trees,
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
them pigeons'll go to him.

    Come all without, come all within,
    You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.

A lamp gate, a gunny dew, I can't recite them all **)
Just tell me where it hurts ***)
And I'll tell you who to call 
Nobody can get no sleep,
There's someone on ev'ryone's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
Ev'rybody's gonna doze.

    Come all without, come all within,
    You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.
