It's a simple chord progression . . .
A > F#m > Bm > E
but Trey plays it like this:
 
H-O
    A  F#m   Bm          E
E---9----9-----7------------
B--10---10-----7---------9--
G---9---11-----7---------9--
D--11---11-----9---------9--
A--12----9-----9---9-11-(11)
E--------------7------------

Remember all the days in the pond
Catchin' wild trout till the break of dawn
Now that you've become a man, looking very mean
Got a nice shiny sports car, keep it very clean

Don't ask him what it was, tell him what it is
Sing the song now

Ya mar, ya mar, ya mar, ya mar,
ya mar, ya mar, ya mar, you're no good pah

She used to be a vampire child, walkin' in the yard
Now that she's become a woman, lookin' very proud
You used to wear a piece of cloth tied around your head
Now she looks so good, wanna love you dead

Don't ask her what it was, tell her what it is
Sing the song now

Ya mar, ya mar, ya mar, ya mar, ya mar, ya mar,
ya mar, you're no good pah
