Here's Old Home Place...this is in A though I've heard them do it in A#
and B...lyrics probably need help too

Verse
     A          C#7         D           A
It's been ten long years since I left home
     A               E
The hollow were I was born
     A          C#7         D           A
Where the cool fall nights make the woods grow fast
     A        E           A
And foxhunter blows his horn

Chorus
 E                        A
What have they done to the old home place
 B                  E
Why did they tear it down
 A          C#7          D             A
And why did I leave the plow   in the field
 A             E           A
And look for a job in the town

Lyrics

It's been ten long years since I left home
The hollow where I was born
Were cool fall nights make the woods grow fast
And foxhunter blows his horn

I fell in love with a girl from the town
Thought that she would be true
I ran away to Charlottesville
And worked in a sawmill or two

Chorus
What have they done to the old home place
Why did they tear it down
And why did I leave the plow in the field
And look for a job in the town

Now the girl ran off with somebody else
Tariffs took all my pay
And here I stand were the old home stood
Before they took it away

Now geese fly south when the cold winds blow
As I stand here and hang my head
I lost my love I lost my home
Now I wish that I was dead

Repeat Chorus
Solo
Repeat Chorus
Repeat last line of chorus
