Intro: a little piano, then F  Am

G                       F            C
There is a place on the mountain nearby
G                       F         C
Deep in a cave but it’s up rather high
G                         F         C
There in the darkness are safely concealed
G                       F          C
All of the dreams that you never revealed


Chorus 1:
F         C         F         C  
If you go there and after you do
F            C               G
All of these dreams would be yours to pursue
    Am           C        F           C
The rest of your lifetime devoid of a care
       G                       F                 C
If you keep your eyes open you may find yourself there

[repeat intro]


G           F        C
Such is the promise, such is the curse
G              F              C
You could just live your life better or worse
G           F               C
Knowing the cache of dreams up on that hill
G                           F            C
Beckons and sways but won't bend to your will


Chorus 2:
F                C     F       C  
You might find a river under a mountain
     F         C       G
That feeds a remote subterranean fountain
Am               C            F         C
Drink from this, taste just a hint of a dream
     G                       F           C  
That somehow leaked into the underground stream
