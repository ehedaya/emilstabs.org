This song is a lot different if you don't have the timing right.

It starts off with Page doing a piano riff and Trey comes in playing
this:

E--6-6-8-6-8---5-7-5-------------------------|
B-------8-----7-----7-5---------5---5--------|
G----------------------7-4---4-7-4-7-7-4-----|
D-------------------------7-4-----------7-4--|
A--------------------------------------------|
E--------------------------------------------|
             H/O
E--6---------------|
B---9-6-------5-6--|
D------8-6-6-8---6-|
G---------8--------|
A------------------|
E------------------|

Slide up to this 13 from about 10 frets down:
                                                   P/O P/O
E-----------12-13-15-12------------12---------12--12-15-13-12---|
B--13--13-15-----------15-13--13-15--13--13-15--13-----------13-|
G----12---------------------12---------12-----------------------|
D---------------------------------------------------------------|
A---------------------------------------------------------------|
E---------------------------------------------------------------|
            slide up
E---------------------|
B--14-13-12-11-----14-|   -Drill each of these note for
G---------------------|          one bar each-

Here is where the verses begin.
first verse:

Blind me with ambition like a razor to the throat
cast aside your foolish pride I'll cast the final vote
the feelings you've been waiting for are clawing thru your skin
and if you look above you'll see the vultures moving in

these chords:
C#  B

After singing Trey busts this line out:(it's pretty fast)

E--------------------6-------------------6-------------------6-|
B--8-6-4-8-6-4-8-6-4---8-6-4-8-6-4-8-6-4---8-6-4-8-6-4-8-6-4---|

E--------------------------|
B--6-4-2-6-4-2-6-4-2-6-4-2-|

E--------------------7-------------------7-------------------7-|
B--9-7-5-9-7-5-9-7-5---9-7-5-9-7-5-9-7-5---9-7-5-9-7-5-9-7-5---|

Then It goes back through the whole intro guitar part again.

Then the next verse:


Timing is everything, that much I know.
sometimes I'm fast(er) and sometimes I'm slow
I exceed expectations but some days I'm told
to go to the end of the line.
But when I can't be what's expected of me
I look at the clock and say this can't be
watching it pass without reason or rhyme
I find myself drifting in time

(Repeat replacing last line with)

I see the vultures moving in (repeat)

(Fish repeats some phrases in here: "I find myself drifting in time")

Then Instead of going to the C# go to D# and do a D# C# progression
and this is the jam part.  When done jamming the guitar and band
goes back to the D# C# progression again for three times (not four)
