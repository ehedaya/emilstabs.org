Gm
there is the tower 
like a solitary flower 
standing in the snow 
as the wolves all wait below 
C
and you're walking on the ledge 
throwing bread crusts off the edge 
Gm
as you sing in voice so clear 
and my name I think I hear 
Fm
concealed within the theme 
C
then it disappears as 
Gm
steam 

and I'm standing far below 
watching wolves you seem to know 
as your voice still carries on 
in your never-ending song 
and my blood begins to boil 
and my bones melt into oil 
hissing liquid in the snow 
as my body sinks below 
and a ripple sends a beam 
of sunlight dancing through the steam 

my now unfettered soul 
has direction I control 
to your tower I draw near 
but do I see a trace of fear? 
the approaching sound of hooves 
now scatters all the wolves 
you briefly watch the horseman ride 
then you quickly run inside 
the rider's weapons gleam 
while the horse's nostrils steam 

there's no time to reflect, who 
is this man? I must protect you 
in the rider's hand I see 
he holds your prison's only key 
he glances up and glares 
and then he starts to climb the stairs 
I can tell you're terrified 
so I quickly go inside 
but then I hear a fateful scream 
and your soul joins mine as 

Eb
steam 

Dm or Dadd9  Jam

we escaped the dreadful night 
and as lovers soared in flight 
blissful weeks turned into seasons 
but one day without a reason 
or goodbye you flew below 
back to the animals you know 
now you forever sing your song 
with the wolves where you belong 
now quite alone I often dream 
I hear you singing through the steam
