(verse 1)

E7
The Cabo Wabo's everywhere
E7
It's on my skin and in my hair
        A7                              E7
And Louise,  I think I'm falling for you
B7                   G           A          E7
Might go down easy, this is my Cayman Review
E7
I don't know how you did the rest
E7
sixteen men on a dead man's chest
    A7                                  E7
Louise, I can't seem to get enough of you
B7                    G           A         E7
Might go down easy,  this is my Cayman Review


(chorus 1)

    A7                                              E7
I'm feeling kind of funny and i feel i'm sinking down
    A7
My head it starts a spinnin as i tumble to the ground
         G                             B7                     E7
Thinking I spent all my money just a chasing you around, Louise
      E7
Louise -------------------------------------------------------
      A7
Louise--------------------------------------------------------
      E7
Louise--------------------------------------------------------

B7-----------      G ------     A ---          E7
                                          Louise

(improv solo melody over the verse progression)


 (chorus 2)

     A7                                                E7
I know that you've got it and you know what it's for
    A7
Cause when you start to shake it, and then you shake a little more
  G                           B7                          
Shake me up, shake me down, shakin that thing all over town
 E7
(Shake me up, shake me down, shakin that thing all over town)
 E7
(Shake me up, shake me down, shakin that thing all over town)
 A7
(shake me up, shake me down, shakin that thing all over town)
 E7
(shake me up, shake me down, shakin that thing all over town)
 B7                          G           A
(Shake me up, shake me down---------------------------
 E7
(shake me up, shake me down, shakin that thing all over town)

(more improv over the verse progression)

E7
It's on my skin and in my hair
   A7

                                 E7
I can't seem to get enough of you
  B7                  G          A         E7
Might go down easy, this is my Cayman Review
  B7                  G          A         E7
Might go down easy, this is my Cayman Review
