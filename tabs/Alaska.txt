Verse 1 & 2:
C7 
I always had to tell her to relax
        F                              C7
And the cat can slip in doors, through multitudes of cracks
         F9                 C         F9                  C
And it’s funny what they’ll do, cause cracks lead outside too
       D7
When I asked her where she’s goin’
         G
She said far away from you

C7
Stuck here on my own now, diggin’ down deep
F                          C7
I don’t understand it, but I ain’t losin’ sleep
              F9  C        F9                C
I’m not gonna lay down, or head north out of town
D7        
I don’t know, but I think I’ll go
    G
And try dog mushin’ with an Eskimo


Chorus:
    C7
In Alaska, Alaska...I think I’ll try Alaska
F                                G
Somewhere she could wait for me, I’ll catch up just wait and see
C7                        Em7       F
Idaho, Nebraska...I don’t know I’ll ask her
G                                    C7       *riff
I think I’ll try...I think I’ll try Alaska

Verse 3 & 4:
C7
I sold my old piano for the rent
F                              C7
I loaded up on bug spray and I found my daddy’s tent
           F9   C           F9    C
Now I’m in high gear, doin’ forty-five
D7       
I’m hummin’ a tune, I won’t see the moon
     G
Till sometime in July

C7
I guess I could’ve flown or took a train
F                                    C7
But you won’t see a moose, if you’re sittin’ on a plane
                F9      C                 F9    C
And now there’s no more road, but I got a light load
           D7
And if she isn’t in Alaska
     G
I’ll stay and pan for gold


Chorus:
    C7
In Alaska, Alaska...I think I’ll try Alaska
F                                G
Somewhere she could wait for me, I’ll catch up just wait and see
C7                        Em7       F
Idaho, Nebraska...I don’t know I’ll ask her
G                                    C7
I think I’ll try...I think I’ll try Alaska


Bridge:
B                              E
Just when I thought I’d end up alone
A                         D                D#7
Big ol’ ‘laskan mama come walkin’ down the road


(jam 2x over Chorus – stay on last G 4x – don’t hit last C7)


Chorus:
C7
Alaska, Alaska...I’ll stay right here in Alaska
F                                G
All settled down and hav’in fun, here in the land of the midnight sun
      C7                                 Em7       F
Is it time to call the pastor?...I don’t know I’ll ask her
G                              
I’ll stay right here...I’ll stay right here	(repeat this part 4x, ending is F to C)
