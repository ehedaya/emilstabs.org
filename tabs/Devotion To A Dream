Devotion To A Dream
1/8/14 - John Manidis
Based off of 12/30/13


This is my first time actually writing out chords -- I usually try to remember them all -- but I figured since I use Emil’s Tabs SO much, I’d contribute! Feel free to correct my mistakes! (Please excuse the lack of captializtion, Phish.net had to be that way!)


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B


*I usually throw some alternating B’s in there to sound good!


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more promises that no one could keep
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more lies to keep us from sleep
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more phone calls when you don't say what you mean
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
I've got faith in a fairytale, devotion to a dream


E -> B -> F# -> G#m
no more knowing glances or places we can hide
C# -> B -> C#
no more chances to keep this thing alive
E -> B -> F# -> G#m
the two of us together it wasn't in the grand scheme
C# -> B -> C#
all it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
devotion to a dream


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B (Repeat)
(Solo)


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more promises no more keeping score
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more wondering what I stay here for


E -> B -> F# -> G#m
we broke the awkward silence with polite and practiced lies
C# -> B -> C#
