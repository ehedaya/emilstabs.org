<pre> Here is the basic form of the song.  Please add any corrections, as this is far from perfect.

D (all D's may be Dm)
A song I heard the ocean sing
D
A shining light in darkness deep
D
I prayed a prayer into the tide
D
And both they soothed me in my sleep

G
For every season that has passed I prayed a prayer into the
tide
G
A shining light in darkness deep in me
G         A
Ten years before the mast

D
For every season that has passed 
D
I laid my body over the side
D
A shining light in darkness deep
D
I prayed a prayer into the tide

G
How can I answer questions I've known?
G
How can I answer questions I've known?
G
How can I answer questions I've known?
G                A
How can I answer questions I've known?

D
A song I heard the ocean sing
D
A shining light in darkness deep
D
Ten years before the mast
D
I heard the ocean sing
