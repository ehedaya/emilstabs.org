Winterqueen
Phish

This is my first contribution, I really loved the intro guitar progression so I sat down and figured it out. 
I looked at the fingering for the intro on the webcast so I think its pretty correct. Theres a few times where Trey 
hits a harmonic on the B string 12th fret instead of the Bsus4 so just play around with it. Hope you like it.

Intro:
       B     Bsus4   E   B        E   C#m7      
E------11-------12---7---7--7-----7----9-------
B----12--12-----12---9---7---7----9----9-------
G--11------11---11---9---8----8---9----9-------
D--------------------9---9--------9----9-------
A----------------------------------------------
E----------------------------------------------

B            Bsus4       E      B       E  C#m7
  The winterqueen looks up and sighs

A             E                  B    Bsus4  E  B  E  C#m7
  I wish that I controlled the skies

A          E                 C#m           A                 B    Bsus4  E  B  E  C#m7
  For up above is where to stand, to rule those who walk on land
  
The summer queen flies by and sees
Her realm of butterflies and bees
And says I wish I lived below, instead I sail where breezes blow

D               A             D             A               C#m     B
  And then the rain came down, it tried to seep into the ground
  
D               A                       D             A          E               B    F#
But water deep pushed and poked, and sodden soil already soked began to roil



Then strum a B5 high up on the neck for a while, going into a little solo
E----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------7------

The rest is pretty much the same starting from the beginning of the first verse, except where they play the D chord its 
just a jam in B Major. Play around the B mixolydian and you should be fine. To end the song they just go back into the 
intro a few times.

The prince of silence walks below
inside a cave of ice and snow
he says "I wonder why?" but words
are locked in glaciers, never heard

The prince of music on guitar
neglects to play a single bar
but music trapped inside his head
resounds and fills the space instead

The winter queen looks up and sighs
