This tuner uses computer generated sine waves which are mathematically perfectly pitched.  They correspond to the open strings.

This tuner uses computer generated sine waves which are mathematically perfectly pitched also, except they correspond to the 5th fret harmonic on the E, A, and D strings, and the 12th fret harmonics on the G, B, and high E strings.  This is the most accurate of the three tuners.

This tuner has samples of each string of my guitar, tuned as best as I could.  It is the least accurate of the three, and is not recommended, but is fun to play with. :)

As a tip, if you are ever out of reach of a tuner, reach for the telephone instead - a dial tone is a low F note (hold down the first fret) on the low E string.  That will at least put you in the right range.
