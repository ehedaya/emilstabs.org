"Hey Page. Where you been?"
"Where've I been?"

G 
strum to start song (Really it's the piano. All of the chords are played on piano until the guitar part starts. Drums and bass and maybe guitar too but most noticeably these chords are played on piano).

(Another thing is these chords are CLOSE. To me it doesn't sound 100% so fix it if you can please.)

                    C 
I been around a while.
                      F
I lived in town a while.
                       G
I threw it down a while.
        G    F    Em   Dm C
And the town came down on me.  (into the guitar part C's below)

C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C   G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G
(The chords above are played right before the solo guitar part.)


This is the guitar part Trey rocks on top of the same chords that accompany the lyrics.

This sounds pretty good. But when I figured it out the progression seemed to sound better with these chords.

                    C 
I been around a while.
                      G7
I lived in town a while.
                       C(add5)(play the G note, 3rd fret, on the hi E instead of leaving it open)
I threw it down a while.
        F         G        C
And the town came down on me.
