Just the chord changes and lyrics:

       E                           B
Well, I used to wake the mornin’, before the rooster crowed
E                             A               F#
Searchin’ for soda bottles to get myself some dough
E                          B
Run ‘em down to the corner, down to the country store
A                                                  E
Cash ‘em in and give my money to a man named Curtis Lowe

E              B              A           E
Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair
E             B                 D              A
When he had a fifth of wine, he did not have a care
E                  B              A                 E
He used own an old Dobro, used to lay it across his knee
E            B                   D                E
I’d give old Curt my money, he’d play all day for me

A                      E
Play me a song, Curtis Lowe, Curtis Lowe
A                          E
I got your drinkin’ money, tune up your Dobro
A                                                F#
People said he was useless, them people all were fools
      E                   D                 A             E
Cause Curtis Lowe was the finest picker, to ever play the blues

He looked to be 60, maybe I was 10
Mama used to whoop me, but I’d go see him again
I’d clap my hands and stomp my feet, tryin’ to stay in time
He’d play me a song or two, then he’d take another drink of wine

Play me a song, Curtis Lowe, Curtis Lowe
I got your drinkin’ money, tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless, them people all were fools
‘Cause Curtis Lowe was the finest picker, to ever play the blues

On the day ol’ Curtis died, nobody came to pray
An ol’ preacher said some words, and they chucked him in the clay
He lived a lifetime playin’ the black man’s blues
And on the day that he lost his life, that was all he had to lose

Play me a song, Curtis Lowe, Curtis Lowe
I wish that you was here so everyone would know
People said you were useless, them people all were fools
‘Cause Curtis, you were the finest picker, to ever play the blues
