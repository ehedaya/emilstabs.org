I'm not sure about a lot of these lyrics.  I checked the lyrics file
at Phish net but this tune wasn't in there.

C#            B
Goin' down to Lushington

F#              C#
Red heels at my nose

C#                  B
The sun is beatin' down on me

        Bbm                Eb
I've got cheese between my toes

C  F  Bb

Eb                 C#
Traffic is movin' slowly

       G#                Eb
and I'm feeling a little sick

Eb                 C#  
I bend down where nobody can see me

     Cm              E#
and I give my nose a pick

D  G  C

E#                   Eb             Bb            E#
I've been down about Reagen and bombs and wars and tax

E#                 Eb
I stick my little finger in my ear

     Dm                   G
and I pull out a clump of wax

Eb  G
