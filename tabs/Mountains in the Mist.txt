Hey all, this ballad is the best.  The chord progression is awesome
as well as the lyrics, vocals and harmonies.  I hope you enjoy, the
only thing that is bugging me is that D right before the chorus.
If anyone has any idea on what chord this is, please let me know.
Also I don't own a guitar,(only a bass and piano)so if some of the
chords don't sound full enough or too full that's the reason.  I'm
pretty sure the riffs are correct though(I do know how to play, just
don't have access to one to play with the chord formations, some of
which are inverted).


intro(guitar)
              C      G  [C   G(these 2 are piano)
E----------3---3------3---0---0----------------

G------2-------0------0---0---0---------------
D--2/3---------2------0---2---2---------------
A--------------3------2---3---3--------------
E--------------0------3---0---0---------------


lyrics come in on the first G chord whenever ready.


G                C                G         Bb     C
several times un-consciously I've  stumbled on the path
Amin       G               D   Bb   C   F
and seen a mountain in the mist
G                   C              G     Bb     C
As rain falls on my shoulders, sun rises in the east
Amin         G            
I'm worn and bruised, but
Csus2    D         G  Bb  Amin  C   Eb   Bb
I am   here at   least

then back to.....(2X)
              C      G  [C   G(these 2 are piano)

B--------1-----1------3---5---3---------------

G                   C        G         Bb       C
I guess I'm just an obstacle   a thing to overcome
Amin              G
If I can sneak around myself and
D         D/C           D/B    D/A
again,  I'll know I've won
G                  C    
The moment seems to hang and float
G         Bb      C
before me with no end
Amin              G
til I'm realeased, awake in peace(awakened beast???)
Csus2      D      G  Bb   Amin  C  Eb   Bb
I'm on the road again

Eb                    Bb
But now I'm soaring f-a-r too high
Bbm                 F
A fleck of dust up in the sky where
Dmin           C
tiny clouds go   sailing by
Bb           Csus2(**)
Pull me down   today

** - little riff after vocals
 Csus2(today...)

then back to.....(4X)
              C      G  [C   G(these 2 are piano)
E----------3---0------3-----------------------

G            C             G    Bb        C
woven in the fairytales we fabricate each day
Amin               G          
are little golden strands of truth that
D       D/C    D/B    D/A (bass does a walk down from D>C>B>A>....
glimmer in the light
G              C         G      Bb      C
the colorful material we hold a certain way
Amin                G
to keep us from the cold and help to
Csus2    D         G  Bb  Amin  C   Eb  Bb
get us through the night


But now I'm soaring far too high
a fleck of dust up in the sky
where tiny clouds go sailing by
Pull me down today
Bb              Csus2
Pull me down today
Bb
Pull me down today
Bb
Pull me down.......

jam "trippilly"(with lots of swells) over the psychedelic Bb to Csus2
progression and have a blast!!!!  Peace.
