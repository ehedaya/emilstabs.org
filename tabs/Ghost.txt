Well I finally got around to finishing this, although there really isn't
that much too it. The chords are played like this:
  Am7  Am6  D9 E7+9
E|----------(5)-----|
B|-10---10---5---8--|
G|-12---11---5---7--|
D|-10---10---4---6--|
A|-----------5---7--|
E|-12---12----------|

I find this fingering easier to use, though it's the
same thing essentially.

  Am7 Am6
E|-5----5---|
B|-8----7---|
G|-5----5---|
D|-7----7---|
A|-0----0---|
E|----------|
Listen to a tape for the timing, its pretty simple but hard to describe here.
Also, Trey doesn't always play the Am6, leaving it to Page.

Am7         Am6
I feel I've never told

Am7      Am6
you the story of the

Am7      Am6            
ghost who I once knew and

Am7                  Am6
talked to of whom I'd never boast

D9
But this was my big secret

D9
How I get ahead

D9
And never have to worry

D9           E7+9
I'd call him instead

Am7         Am6    
His answer came in action

Am7       Am6
He never spoke a word

Am7      Am6
Or maybe I lay down the

Am7     Am6
phone before he could be heard

D9
I somehow feel forsaken

D9
Like he had closed the door

D9
I guess I just stopped needing him

D9              Am7
I much as once before

Jam over 1 verse of chords; Am7 to Am6, then D9 part

Am7      Am6
But maybe he's still

Am7     Am6
with me the latch was left unhooked

Am7          Am6
He's waiting in the wind and rain

Am7                   D9
I simply haven't looked

Am7      Am6
I feel I never told you

Am7  Am6           A7#9     (4x)
the story of the ghost

Jam on Am7 Am6

That's it. Suggestions welcome.

For the most part it's all:

G |-------------------------------------------
D |--------7---------------------7-----------
A |------7---------------------7-------------
E |---5---------5-5--------5----------5-5---   
 
That repeats a lot.  Im not sure of the slap section, but when they come back in 
from that little break and Trey's pick slide, it's:

G |-------------
D |---5---7---
A |------------
E |-----------

Thats all the important stuff
