**This version is from the Vegas 2000 shows.  I am using a shitty
guitar and this may not be the accurate key, but it is all
transposable anyways.  

Eric claims that this needs to be moved down a half step to be in the right key.

First break:  (C to F - the change is implied but I'm not sure if Trey
              <Mike in this case> is really fretting the F triad)

The "Wallfreeedo" part is just F to C .. thats really all there is to
it.  The guitar riff that accompanies the Piano melody I have not been
able to figure out since my copy of the shows isn't clear enough to
accurately distinguish between the two.  But this should get some
thoughtful folks started.
