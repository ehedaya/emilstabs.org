I just love this song, perhaps underdeveloped (only performed 4 times) but what beautiful lyrics and that signature riff...
A pity its not been tabbed yet, but here are the lyrics!


The sound of flying swiftly, which makes it hard to find
Pathway through the darkness, every time I fall behind
I think I hear a whisper, around nearly every turn
But what the voice is saying, I barely can discern
The echoes that are following the contours of the ground
Ebb and flow and eddies in, a tidal wave of sound
And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning of expressions, I barely can discern
And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning of expressions I barely can discern
The echoes that are following the contours of the ground
Evbb and flow and eddies in, a tidal wave of sound


And through the mist, I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning the of expressions I barely can discern
