Phish:  Secret Smile*

*Live version faster and in a different key


A                  E
Sometimes when the evening's young,
    D                    A
the wind dies down.  The setting sun
    D                    A       C#m  
crochets the clouds with yarn so fine
E                        A
and fills the oceans with red wine.
A                       E
The trees, the sky, the forest fair
D                     A
bring a flavor to the air.
  D                   A     
I raise my glass, and in a while
        E                   A
you answer with a secret smile.

Chorus
F#m  E         C#m  D
Hold on...    Hold on  

F#m  E           A        D C#m Bm A  /  Bm A C#m D
Hold on...    to me...  

An airborne leaf that landed near,
has carried Dionysus here.
He'll slip away, but only when,
he sees our glasses filled again.
Sometimes when the evening's young,
the wind dies down, the setting sun,
crochets the clouds with yarn so fine,
and fills the oceans with red wine.

Hold on, Hold on, Hold on to me...
