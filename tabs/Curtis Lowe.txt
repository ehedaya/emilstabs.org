Just the chord changes and lyrics:

       E                           B
Well, I used to wake the morninÀ, before the rooster crowed
E                             A               F#
SearchinÀ for soda bottles to get myself some dough
E                          B
RunÀem down to the corner, down to the country store
A                                                  E
CashÀem in and give my money to a man named Curtis Lowe

E              B              A           E
Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair
E             B                 D              A
When he had a fifth of wine, he did not have a care
E                  B              A                 E
He used own an old Dobro, used to lay it across his knee
E            B                   D                E
IÀd give old Curt my money, heÀd play all day for me

A                      E
Play me a song, Curtis Lowe, Curtis Lowe
A                          E
I got your drinkinÀ money, tune up your Dobro
A                                                F#
People said he was useless, them people all were fools
      E                   D                 A             E
Cause Curtis Lowe was the finest picker, to ever play the blues

He looked to be 60, maybe I was 10
Mama used to whoop me, but IÀd go see him again
IÀd clap my hands and stomp my feet, tryinÀ to stay in time
HeÀd play me a song or two, then heÀd take another drink of wine

Play me a song, Curtis Lowe, Curtis Lowe
I got your drinkinÀ money, tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless, them people all were fools
ÆCause Curtis Lowe was the finest picker, to ever play the blues

On the day olÀ Curtis died, nobody came to pray
An olÀ preacher said some words, and they chucked him in the clay
He lived a lifetime playinÀ the black manÀs blues
And on the day that he lost his life, that was all he had to lose

Play me a song, Curtis Lowe, Curtis Lowe
I wish that you was here so everyone would know
People said you were useless, them people all were fools
ÆCause Curtis, you were the finest picker, to ever play the blues
