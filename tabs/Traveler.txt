Gm
Whenever I think that I'm losing control, think that my life force will split from my soul
      F        C 
And I feel, my future lies under my tongue

Gm
I wait for a bell which will never be rung, I know that I need to step over the line
      F        C                         D
And I feel, my roots growing strong over time

A#                     C        F               A#
That's when I start to hear the freeway calling for me
A#             C                    D
Others hear it too, we just have to trust

Gm
That we choose the right traveler, from out of the crowd
      D#         A#                 F
Don't choose the friendly one who's talking too loud
      D#         A#              F
Don't choose the one filled with plans but no dreams
      D#         A#         F
Don't choose the one who is not what he seems

D                               Gm
And if you stand still, you are traveling too,
C                  A#                Gm
making it easy for someone to choose you.

Gm      F       D# ... D#     Dm     C ... C     ??     ??

F        C           G          F

      C           G                          F
We're all on the run, and we all share one voice
         C                  G                        F
and in a great while we all make the right choice
   C               G                                 F
We trust the right moment, and everything clicks
                C               G
You see the way forward and you move just a bit
F           C          G  
And you are traveling again for the best
F           C              G
Making your next choice as good as the rest
F            C             G
If you stand still you are traveling too
F          C           G
Making it easy for someone to choose you
F          C               G
Maybe you feel those other eyes upon you
F          C          G     
Making it easy for someone to choose you
F          C          G
Making it easy...


The rest of the song is that same F/C/G chord progression while Trey solos. Also the lyrics continue like

F      C           G
Oooooooooh you are traveling, traveling
F            C              G
If you stand still, you are traveling, traveling

etc.
