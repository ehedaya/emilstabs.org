chorus: My mind's got a mind of its own
       It takes me out a-walkin' when I'd rather stay at home
       It takes me out to parties when I'd rather be alone
       My mind's got a mind of its own

I've been doing things I thought I'd never do
I've been getting into trouble without ever meaning to
I no sooner settle down when I'm right back up again
I feel just like a leaf out in the wind

Chorus
I seem to forget half the things I start
I try to build a house and then I tear the place apart
I freeze myself on fire and then I'd burn myself on ice
I canUt count to one without thinking twice

Chorus
I tell myself to do the things I should
And then I get to thinkin' that them things ain't any good
I tell myself the truth but I know I'm lying like a snake
You can't walk on water at the bottom of a lake

chorus
