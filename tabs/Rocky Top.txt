an EZ play organ book, and note that it is in the key of CMaj. I don't

Wish that I was on ol' Rocky top
Down in the Tennesse hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky top
Ain't no telephone bills

I was strumming through rocky top today and realized that the boys play it out of
G, rather than Cmaj.  So the verse would be as follows



G               C      G
Wish that I was on old ROcky Top
Em          D         G
Down in the Tennessee Hills
G              C        G
aint no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Em       D         G
aint no telephone bills

And the chorus
Em               D
Rocky Top, youll always be
F               C
home sweet home to me
C       G
Good ol Rocky top
Em        D       G           Em        D       G
Rocky top tennessee           Rocky top Tennessee
