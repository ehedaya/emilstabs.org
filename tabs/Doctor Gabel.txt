Dr. Gabel
(Trey Anastasio?)

	This is a pretty straight ahead rocker, and trey noodles a bit with the chords as he always will-
especially those Gs at the end of lines) but this will get you going- add 9s and 13s to dress them up some. 
Meanwhile you can listen to trey talk about his shrink and getting his “vase glued.” 
Also, he uses his super power trey E chord: 0-11-9-9-9 in places, of course. The lyrics aren't perfect, either, but close!


B

The end section is a flurry of 4 note descending pattern starting from the F# on the high E string and moving through the B string. 
The pattern seems to be as follows with the chords on the piano:

F#-D#-C-A#

F#-E-C-B

E-C#-B-G#

E-D-B-A 

F#-E-C-B

These repeat until the end! It’s a lot like the end of “bouncin”, in function~
