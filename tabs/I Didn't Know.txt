I Didnâ€™t Know
Phish

(a capella)

I didn't know, 
I didn't know 
Well I didn't like cheeseburger alley cats near me 
A petrified Phish disease I wish somebody'd hear me 
I didn't like maple dew honey melon watercress 
I didn't like Phish shoes down by muddy watermelon 
I didn't seem to miss you when you kiss'd my honey water 
And even showed a picture showed her down by honey's border 
But who laid silver tooth and broke my sunny shoe shine 
And all my plastic melodreams are waiting for their new shine 

Pardon me, Doug (pardon me, Doug) 
Is this a picture of Otis Redding? 
Yes! Yes! Taken right before he died 
Well you can give me his hide (well you can give me his hide) 

(I didn't know) I didn't know that I was that far gone (8x) 


(vacuum solo)


Well I woulda' liked to seen Bess Truman come see me 
And hear all the revolutionaries come free me 
'Cause if it all ends up running to sneeze me 
I'll make it all here black corners come seize me 
And if you boom back got troubles in your ear 
And you can't seem to come back and make it all clear 
When eye tails and toe nails and liquid all meet me 
When mustard pies and carrot eyes and flounders come greet me 

(I didn't know) I didn't know that I was that far gone (8x)

Pardon me, Doug (pardon me, Doug) 
Is this a picture of Otis Redding? 
Yes! Yes! Taken right before he died 
Well you can give me his hide (well you can give me his hide!!!!!!)
