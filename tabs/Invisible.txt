Invisible- by Trey Anastasio from "Shine"  - tabbed by Berneymac

This is just the basic chord rundown of the song. You experts can add in the solo or fine tune it if you want

Intro: play around with this. This is my first time composing tab so fool around with it

   E           
E--9---9-----------7--------7----------9--
B--9---10p>9-------9s>10----9----------9--
G--9---9-----------7--------7----------9--    (x2)
D--9---9-----------9--------9----------9--
A--7---7-----------7--------7----------7--
E-----------------------------------------

Then C>G>D>A>E

Verse 1: (I kinda hammer the 5th string while playing the E to carry the chord)


E                           A
Last time....when you were waiting for me...
E                       A
I tried....to tell you all we had was a
C                        G
Wrapped up scene like I knew that it would
   D                     A           E
It all seems thin but it sure feels good.
                C                       G
Cause it's the best I've seen when you fall down good
D                             A         E
Sink in the water but you're walkin on wood.


Verse 2:

E                           A
This time....what are you waiting for is it
E                     A
Your time....to walk away because the
C            G
Laws unseen levels all good
    D                     A            E
The hurdles all down like another time would
               C                       G  
Cause it's the best I've seen when you fall down should
D                            A         E
Sink in the water but you're walkin on wood.


Bridge:

B
Last I've seen walkin on wood
C
Downstream driftin like a longtime should
G
But now we're invisible
    D  
So all that's good
B
Laws unseen levels all good

C
Downstream driftin like a long time should
G
But now we're invisible
   D          E
So all that's good.



Verse 3: (this verse alone is soo meaningful and poignant)

E                        A
Next time....and I could wait forever
E                        A
Old times....because I thought I'd never
C                      G
Wrap that scene like I knew that I should
    D                   A         E
We all seem thin but it sure felt good.
               C                       G
Cause it's the best I've seen when you fall down good
 D                            A        E
Sink in the water but you're walkin on wood.


A          E
Walkin on wood.......

E                                  D                          A
Last time......walkin on wood.....now we're invisible....and all that's good.









I really dig this tune, I hope you all enjoy playing it as much as I do.
