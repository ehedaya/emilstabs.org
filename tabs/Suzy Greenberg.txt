Verse 1:
D            C                  G
Little Suzie Greenberg with her head caved in
D                C                 G
Soon will let me drown beneath the undertow
D                   C          G
You better put that woman in a loony bin
D                          C            G
'Cause you know I'd really like to be a part of her show

C           A           D
Suzie is an artist, she paints quite a lot
C                 A         D
An artist she may be, but a genius she is not
C                     A        D
She says she wants to be a Sociologist
C                        A            G
But she better first get checked by a neurologist

Chorus:
D
Suzie, Suzie, Suzie, Suzie,
C            G
Suzie, Suzie Greenberg

Guitar Solo
Am  x8 Bars

Piano Solo
|D  C  |G     | x4

Verse 2:
Suzie's 'bout as faithful
As a slot machine
Pays off once in a while
But then she'll rob you clean
She's always afraid
That she's not sure what she's worth
She's out of her mind
And she's not of this earth

The woman walks the streets
Like she's the queen of the town
Doesn't talk very much
She's very profound
Little Suzie Greenberg
Always playing the game
But today I'll bet she's probably
Forgotten my name

[Chrous]

Guitar Solo:
Am  x However many bars you want

Piano Lead Jam:
|D  C  |G     |  x However many times you want

[Verse 1]
[Chorus]

End on:
D
Suzie, Suzie, Suzie, Suzie
C             G
Suzie, Suzie, Greenberg

Member recorded - I recorded this using Reason v2.0.  It sounds nothing like Phish, obviously, but I think it's an interesting variation.  The progression is the middle section where Page usually rocks out.  --[[User:Admin|Emil]] 01:14, 25 Oct 2005 (EDT)
