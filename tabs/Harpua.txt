There's a dog in the station

with an ugly mutation
      Ab         C           D   G
and it needs lubrication each day

Contemplating rotation

as a form of recreation and play
Gb  Ab  Bb
A dog

[chords same as above]
There's a dog in the station
with a bad reputation
It's a sign of the nation's decay

But the dog in the station
doesn't need a vacation
As the people rush by dressed in gray

D D/C Bm7 Bbmaj7 D/A
A DOG
A DOG
A DOG!!
