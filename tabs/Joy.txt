D
Joy is over there in her incredible clothes
        Gmaj7
She has silver silk shimmering down to her toes
      D
I was doing the best that I can I suppose
         Gmaj7
But that little girl dancer eventually grows
         E        fill (b-c-d-c-b on A string)
Well she grows
G  A

D
You can’t imagine all the times that I’ve tried
     Gmaj7
To uncover the source of the tears that you cried
      D
Let’s throw it away and just go for a ride
        Gmaj7
And you'd say okay but you'd keep it inside
      E           fill 
And I tried
 G
I tried
  E                fill
I tried
 G		A
I tried

[Chorus]
G                 D
We want you to be happy
      A               G
Don’t live inside the gloom
                  D
We want you to be happy
     A                 G
Come step outside your room
                  F#m
We want you to be happy
                       A
Cause this is your song too

D
I never thought I could have it so good
G
You were the song that my soul understood
    D
But time is a river that flows through the woods
       G
And it led us to places we both understood
        E
Would be gone
         G
Before too long
        E
Would be gone
         G		A
Before too long

D
When we were young we thought life was a game
         G
But then somebody leaves you and you’re never the same
D
All of the places that people belong
       G
To the puzzle but one of the pieces is gone
         E
And it’s you
 G
It’s you
     E
It’s you
     G			A
Joy it’s you

[Chorus]
G                 D
We want you to be happy
      A               G
Don’t live inside the gloom
                  D
We want you to be happy
     A                 G
Come step outside your room
                  F#m
We want you to be happy
                       A
Cause this is your song too

Em            C            G
In time we’ll weather this storm
         D              A
Inside together you’ll see the change
         C   G      A
When the sun shines through
