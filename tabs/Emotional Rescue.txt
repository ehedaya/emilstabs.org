BREAK: (G and F again, like above break)

      I was dreaming last night
      Last night I was dreaming
      How you'd be mine, but I was crying
      Like a child, yeah, I was crying
      Crying like a child
      You will be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
      You could be mine, could be mine
      Be mine, all mine

VERSE:
      I come to you so silent in the night
      So stealthy, so animal quiet
      I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
      I'll come to your emotional rescue
      I'll come to your emotional rescue
       G                   F      G
      Yeah, you should be mine, whew


SPOKEN VERSE: (RIFF OVER THESE WORDS)

      Yes, you could be mine   Tonight and every night
      I will be your knight in shining armor
      Coming to your emotional rescue
     
      You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
      You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
      I will be your knight in shining armor
      Riding across the desert with a fine Arab charger
