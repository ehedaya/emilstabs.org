C         F                C
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone

C         F             G   
I can see all obstacles in my way

C            F                C
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind

C               Bb               F
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)

         C
Sun shiny day


I think I can make it now, the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is the rainbow I've been prayin' for 
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)
sun shiny day

Eb                                   Bb 
Look all around, there's nothin' but blue skies

Eb                               G          Bm  F  Bm  Bb  Am  G  
Look straight ahead, nothin' but blue skies


I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)
sun shiny day
