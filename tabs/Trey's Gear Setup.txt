Last summer Trey bought some of our pedals and he is now using
them in his setup. You can read more about this at

http://www.analogman.com/phish.htm

He is using two of our TS9/808/Silver mod pedals replacing his
two stock Ibanez TS9 pedals. For more info please see:

He also replaced his old Ross compressor with our
BICOMPROSSOR which is a ross clone plus a Dan Armstrong
Orange Squeezer clone in one pedal.
