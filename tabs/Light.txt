I made a few edits to the one below.


Intro: B -> E 

Chorus:
B               F#            C#m       E
I can't see the light between me and my mind
      B        F#       A          E
I can feel the memories fall---- behind
        B                E
And the light is growing brighter now
        B                E
And the light is growing brighter now

Verse 1:
B         E         F#m           E
I see the future is less and less there
        B        G#m             F#
and the past has vanished in the air
        F#m         E
and I'm left in the now
        F#m     E
with a wondrous glow 
  C#m             B
I think I'm still me 
    D
but how------
          A
would you know------

Verse ending: E   A   D  A

Repeat Chorus

Verse 2:
B              E          F#m       E
It takes a few moments of whirling around
           B            G#m       F#
'till your feet finally leave the ground
    F#m         E
and fending off fears
    F#m         E
and heeding the call
    C#m     B
and finally waiting
    D
for nothing-------
   A
at all--------

Verse ending: E   A   D  A

Repeat Chorus


Repeat:
        B                E
And the light is growing brighter now...


The backup vocals are in 2 sections (below).  
Fish sings #1, Mike/Page sing #2, while Trey sings the main vamp above.
The chords below are there to illustrate "where" the words fall in relation to the
chords above...hope it makes sense.

   E                                              B           
1:(Fantasies unfiltered)            2:(Purify our soul)
   E                                                   B
1:(Obstacles are stepping stones)   2:(Guide us to our goal)



Light/intro to solo:

B ---16-17-19---16-17-19---16-17-19---16-17-19--------

G -------------------------18b20â€”18b20---16-----------
D ----------------------------------------------------
A ----------------------------------------------------
E ----------------------------------------------------

The trick to playing this in time is to do the first 4 pretty quickly 
(almost without regard to the timing of the rest of the song), 
wait a split second, then finish the last 2 and bend up to that Bb.

B -> E (A bunch of times. If you know the song you know what I mean.)
B               F#
