Shine a Light (Jagger/Richards)
From "Exile on Mainstreet"(1972) 

It's in C, pretty simple, the key is the G-A-B walk-ups from C/G to C

Verse:
C                     G
Saw you stretched out in room ten-o-nine 
Am 
With a smile on your face 
    G
And a tear right in your eye 
F                     C/G
Couldn't see to get a line on you
G      F        C/G
My sweet honey love
C               G 
Berber jew'lry jangling down the street 
Am                                G
Make you shut your eyes at ev'ry woman that you meet
F                   C/G
Could not seem to get high on you
G     F        C/G 
My sweet honey love 

Chorus:
C                          G
May the good Lord shine a light on you
F                     C/G 
Make every song your favorite tune 
C                          G
May the good Lord shine a light on you 
F               C/G
Warm like the evening sun 

aaaand so on and so forth, enjoy.

The rest of the lyrics:

Well, you're drunk in the alley, baby 
With your clothes all torn 
And your late night friends 
Leave you in the cold grey dawn 
Just seemed too many flies on you 
I just can't brush them off 

Angels beating all their wings in time 
With smiles on their faces 
And a gleam right in their eyes 
Thought I heard one sigh for you 
Come on up, come on up, now 
Come on up, now 

May the good Lord shine a light on you 
Make every song you sing your favourite tune 
May the good Lord shine a light on you 
Warm like the evening sun

Then there's the solo bridge which is over Am - F - G x4 followed by an instrumental run through of the second part of the verse, 
and they sing the "come on up" part, and then another chorus
