INTRO:

|D   |A   |B   |B   |
The D and A are single hits held for the entire bar.
Then vamp over B for however long you want with a blues feel.

D|-----------------
A|-9---11--9---11--
E|-7---7---7---7---


VERSE:

B                E
Trouble seems to follow me
B                      E
like a lost and lonely dog
B                                F#
I can’t shake it no matter how I run

E                B
And you know and I know
G#m                             E
This heat ain't coming from the sun.
B
And there’ll be lives to save
F#
And hell to pay
E                 F#
Before the day is done


CHORUS:

B                                E
But I’ll burn that bridge when I get to it
B                 F#
Find a fire I can set to it
B                        E
Trouble’s coming but the spark is lit
         D         A              B
And I’ll burn that bridge when I get to it.


VERSE:
(Same chords as the previous verse)

The sunlight in your smile
Pierces me clean through
I been on this earth a while
I met no one like you

And Lord knows I’m a sinner
But something tells me you are too
And I’ll pay tomorrow for what I pray
We’re about to do


[CHORUS]


BRIDGE:

(Chromatic walk from B up to E)
E                             B
Sometimes you gotta break the rules
G#m                E
And throw away the book
F#
Torch the candle at both ends
And leap before you look

(Chromatic walk from F# down to E)
E                  B
You maybe a little crazy
G#m                        E
And God knows I’m no great catch
F#
But you supply the gasoline
And I’ll supply the match


MODIFIED CHORUS:

B                                E
But I’ll burn that bridge when I get to it
B                           F#
I know we shouldn't but the spark is lit.
B                          E
If this is trouble I don't mind a bit.
         D         A              G         A
And I’ll burn that bridge when I get to it.

Burn that bridge Burn that bridge
B
Burn that bridge Burn that bridge
