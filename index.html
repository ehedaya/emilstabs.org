						<p>Welcome to the official unofficial repository of guitar transcriptions to many of the songs played by Phish.

If you have a correction or new submission, please add or edit the file directly in <a href="https://github.com/ehedaya/emilstabs.org">Github</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ehedaya/emilstabs.org/issues">open an issue</a>.

								<h4>Bass tabs from Brad Weiger</h3>
								<p>A trove of over 80 hand-written bass tabs has been generously made available to the community by Brad Weiger, former bassist of the tribute band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lawnboys">The Lawn Boys</a>.  <strong>But we need your help!</strong> If you are able and willing to help transcribe these from their present hand-written-and-scanned format to digital, your help will be much appreciated.  Please save bass tabs in the <a href="https://github.com/ehedaya/emilstabs.org/tree/master/files/bass"><code>bass/</code> subfolder</a>.</p>

This information belongs to the community, so you can <a href="https://github.com/ehedaya/emilstabs.org/archive/master.zip">download a snapshot</a>  of the entire archive and save it to your hard drive at any time.</p>
